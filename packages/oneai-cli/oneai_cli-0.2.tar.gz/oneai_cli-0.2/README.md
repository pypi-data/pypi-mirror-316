**oneai-cli** package is part of *OpenNebula AIOps framework*.

[OpenNebula AIOps](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-AIOps) is an AI-driven component for enabling intelligent operation of [OpenNebula](https://opennebula.io/) cloud deployments. Its main goal is to leverage AI and ML technologies to improve management, monitoring, automation and IT operations of physical/virtual resources and virtualized applications.
When integrated in an OpenNebula deployment, OneAIOps offers smart resource and application management, including capabilities for enhanced observability, predictive analytics and anomaly detection. It integrates seamlessly with the Opennebula platform, and can be configured by user-friendly, interoperable APIs: a Python SDK, a CLI interface, and a REST API. These allow for simple but precise configuration and management of AI-driven insights, smart scheduling of virtual machines and proactive workload optimization.
