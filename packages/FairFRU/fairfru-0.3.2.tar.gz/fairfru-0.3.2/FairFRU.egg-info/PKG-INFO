# Using fuzzy-rough sets to measure bias in pattern classification problems

This python package contains a bias metric based on the paper *"A fuzzy-rough uncertainty measure to discover bias encoded explicitly or implicitly in features of structured pattern classification datasets"* ([Link to publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2022.01.005)). 

This bias metric measures the extent to which a feature in a dataset influences the outcome variable.
