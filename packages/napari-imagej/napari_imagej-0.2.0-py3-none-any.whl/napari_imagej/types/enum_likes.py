"""
A module defining Java "Enum-like"s.
An enum-like can be created for any Enum-like Java types.

We define an Enum-like Java type as a Java type that
1. is stateless
2. has a no-args constructor

The enum-likes are designed for a rather narrow use case, described as follows:

Some Java functionality requires an Object implementing a particular interface.
That Object is usually chosen from a set of established implementations,
each created without variation (giving rise to the above constraints).

In such cases, we can abstract the interface to a JavaEnumLike and the implementations
to enumerations of that JavaEnumLike, as done below.

JavaEnumLikes are NOT intended for direct use. Instead, use enum_like() to obtain
the correct JavaEnumLike for a Java enum-like!
