mpservice
=========

The package ``mpservice`` provides a few groups of facilities. The first group helps ochestrating an operation 
with multiple stages/components in threads and processes, such as a machine learning model;
the second group concerns stream processing, optionally involving threads or processes for concurrency;
the third group provides customization and enhancements to the standard packages ``multiprocessing`` and ``threading``.
The central theme of ``mpservice`` is concurrency by threads or processes.
