## Thingi10K Dataset

![Thingi10K Poster](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3606672/65047743-fa269180-d930-11e9-8013-134764b150c1.png)

Thingi10K is a large scale 3D dataset created to study the variety, complexity and quality of
real-world 3D printing models. We analyze every mesh of all things featured on
[Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
between Sept. 16, 2009 and Nov. 15, 2015. On this site, we hope to share our findings with you.

In a nutshell, Thingi10K contains...

* 10,000 models
* 4,892 tags
* 2,011 things
* 1,083 designers
* 72 categories
* 10 open source licenses
* 7+ years span
* 99.6% .stl files
* 50% non-solid
* 45% with self-intersections
* 31% with coplanar self-intersections
* 26% with multiple components
* 22% non-manifold
* 16% with degenerate faces
* 14% non-PWN
* 11% topologically open
* 10% non-oriented

Thingi10K is created by [Qingnan Zhou](https://research.adobe.com/person/qingnan-zhou/) and [Alec
Jacobson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/).

## Raw dataset

You can download the raw dataset at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Thingi10K/Thingi10K/tree/main).

One can also obtain the dataset via the `thingi10k` Python package. It contains both geometric and
contextual data extracted from the raw dataset, and provides a convenient API to access and filter
the dataset.

## Installation

```sh
pip install thingi10k
```

## Usage

```py
import thingi10k

thingi10k.init() # Initial download of the dataset

# Iterate over the entire dataset
for entry in thingi10k.dataset():
    file_id = entry['file_id']

    # Check contextual data
    author = entry['author']
    license = entry['license']

    # Load actual geometry
    vertices, facets = thingi10k.load_file(entry['file_path'])
```

### Variants

Thingi10K provides two variants of the dataset: `npz` and `raw`.

* `npz` variant contains the geometry (vertex and facet arrays) in NumPy arrays. It is faster to
download and no mesh parsing is necessary.
* `raw` variant contains the raw mesh files (STL, OBJ, etc.) in their original format. It is slower
to download and requires parsing to extract geometric data.

By default, `thingi10k.init()` will download the `npz` variant. To download the `raw` variant:

```py
thingi10k.init(variant='raw')
```

### Caching the dataset

By default, `thingi10k.init()` will cache the dataset in a local directory.
Any subsequent calls to `thingi10k.init()` will use the cached dataset and incur no additional
download cost.
The cache directory can be explicitly specified by user:

```py
thingi10k.init(cache_dir="path/to/.thingi10k")
```

To force a re-download of the dataset:

```py
thingi10k.init(force_redownload=True)
```

### Filtering the dataset

Thingi10K supports advanced filtering of the dataset based on geometric and contextual properties.
See `help(thingi10k.dataset)` for a full list of supported filters. Here are some examples:

```py
# Filter by closed models
closed_models = thingi10k.dataset(closed=True)

# Filter by models without self-intersections
no_self_intersections = thingi10k.dataset(self_intersecting=False)

# Filter by the number of vertices (<100)
small_models = thingi10k.dataset(num_vertices=(None, 100))

# Models with a single component and is manifold
single_manifold_models = thingi10k.dataset(num_components=1, manifold=True)

# Models licensed under the Creative Commons license
cc_models = thingi10k.dataset(license='creative commons')
```

## License

The source code for organizing and filtering the Thingi10K dataset is licensed under the Apache License,
Version 2.0. Each "thing" in the dataset is licensed under different licenses. Please refer to the
`license` field associated with each entry in the dataset.

## Errata

The following models are known to be "corrupt." However, we decide to still include them in our dataset in order to faithfully reflect mesh qualities on Thingiverse.

* Model 49911 is truncated (ASCII STL).
* Model 74463 is empty.
* Model 286163 is empty.
* Model 81313 contains NURBS curves and surfaces instead of polygonal faces, which may not be supported by many OBJ parsers.
* Model 77942 is corrupt (binary STL).
