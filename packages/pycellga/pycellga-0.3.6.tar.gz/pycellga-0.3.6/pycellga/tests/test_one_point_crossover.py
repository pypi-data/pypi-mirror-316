def test_one_point_crossover():
    """
    Test the OnePointCrossover class for generating offspring from two parents.

    This test verifies that the OnePointCrossover class correctly performs one-point crossover
    between two parent individuals. It ensures that:
    1. The offspring generated have the same chromosome size as the parents.
    2. The chromosomes of the offspring contain only valid binary values (0 or 1).

    The test performs the following checks:
    - Both offspring have the same chromosome size.
    - Each chromosome in the offspring is composed of binary values (0 or 1).

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If any of the conditions for the crossover operation are not met.
