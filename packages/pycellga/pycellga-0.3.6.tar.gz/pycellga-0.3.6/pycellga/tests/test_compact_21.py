def test_compact_21():
    """
    Test the Compact21 class for calculating neighbor positions in a grid.

    This test verifies that the Compact21 class correctly calculates the positions
    of the 20 neighbors surrounding a given position in a grid. It ensures that:
    1. The number of neighbors is always 20 for positions not on the boundary of the grid.
    2. Positions on the boundary of the grid still correctly return 20 neighbors.

    The test uses three different positions within the grid to validate the functionality
    of the Compact21 neighborhood calculation.

    Notes
    -----
    The Compact21 neighborhood considers all 20 surrounding cells in a 5x5 grid centered
    on a given position, excluding the cell itself. The grid is assumed to be toroidal,
    meaning that positions on the edges wrap around to the opposite edge.

    The following assertions are made:
    - The number of calculated neighbor positions is 20 for various positions in the grid.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If the number of calculated neighbor positions is not 20.
