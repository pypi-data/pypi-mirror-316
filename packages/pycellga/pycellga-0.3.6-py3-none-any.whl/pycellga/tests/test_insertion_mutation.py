def test_insertion_mutation():
    """
    Test the InsertionMutation class for the Individual class on the TSP problem.

    This test verifies that the InsertionMutation correctly mutates the chromosome of
    an Individual by inserting elements and ensures that the mutation is applied
    correctly. The test checks that:
    1. The chromosome is mutated.
    2. The chromosome size remains unchanged.

    The function uses random permutation for the chromosome initialization.

    Notes
    -----
    The test assumes that the InsertionMutation class correctly implements insertion
    mutation and that the TSP problem correctly evaluates the fitness of an individual.

    The following assertions are made:
    - At least one element in the chromosome is changed.
    - The size of the mutated individualâ€™s chromosome matches the original size.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If any of the conditions for correctness are not met.
