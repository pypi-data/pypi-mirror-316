def test_shuffle_mutation():
    """
    Test the ShuffleMutation class for the Individual class on the TSP problem.

    This test verifies that the ShuffleMutation correctly mutates the chromosome of
    an Individual by shuffling the elements. It ensures that:
    1. The chromosome is mutated.
    2. The chromosome size remains unchanged.

    The function initializes the chromosome with a random permutation of integers
    from 1 to CHSIZE and applies the shuffle mutation.

    Notes
    -----
    The test assumes that the ShuffleMutation class correctly implements shuffle
    mutation and that the TSP problem correctly evaluates the fitness of an individual.

    The following assertions are made:
    - At least one element in the chromosome is changed.
    - The size of the mutated individualâ€™s chromosome matches the original size.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If any of the conditions for correctness are not met.
