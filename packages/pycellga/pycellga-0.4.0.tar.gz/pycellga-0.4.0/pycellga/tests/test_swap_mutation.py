def test_swap_mutation():
    """
    Test the SwapMutation class for the Individual class on the TSP problem.

    This test verifies that the SwapMutation correctly mutates the chromosome of
    an Individual by swapping two elements. It ensures that:
    1. The chromosome is mutated.
    2. The chromosome size remains unchanged.

    The function initializes the chromosome with a random permutation of integers
    from 1 to CHSIZE and applies the swap mutation.

    Notes
    -----
    The test assumes that the SwapMutation class correctly implements swap mutation
    and that the TSP problem correctly evaluates the fitness of an individual.

    The following assertions are made:
    - At least one element in the chromosome is changed.
    - The size of the mutated individualâ€™s chromosome matches the original size.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If any of the conditions for correctness are not met.
