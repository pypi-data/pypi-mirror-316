def test_two_opt_mutation():
    """
    Test the TwoOptMutation class for the Individual class on the TSP problem.

    This test verifies that the TwoOptMutation correctly mutates the chromosome of
    an Individual by applying the 2-opt mutation technique. It ensures that:
    1. The chromosome is mutated by swapping two edges in the permutation.
    2. The chromosome size remains unchanged.

    The function initializes the chromosome with a random permutation of integers
    from 1 to CHSIZE and applies the two-opt mutation.

    Notes
    -----
    The test assumes that the TwoOptMutation class correctly implements the 2-opt mutation
    and that the TSP problem correctly evaluates the fitness of an individual.

    The following assertions are made:
    - At least one element in the chromosome is changed.
    - The size of the mutated individualâ€™s chromosome matches the original size.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If any of the conditions for correctness are not met.
