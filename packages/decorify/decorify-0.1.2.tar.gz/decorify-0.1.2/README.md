Python Library for decorators

Decorify  is a lightweight Python library without any dependencies that offers a collection of simple, reusable decorators to enhance your functions. These decorators cover common use cases like logging, timing, retrying, and more. 

## Installation

Install Decorators via pip:

```bash
pip install decorify 
```

## Table of Content

| Decorator | Main functionality |
| --- | --- |
| timeit | Measures the time of the function |
| timeout | Terminates the function after it runs for too long |
| mute | Disables stdout for duration of decorated function |
| validate_typehints | Ensures that typehints are followed, raising error if not |
| retry | If exception is raised function is retried up to predefined amount of times |
| rate_limiter | Limits number of function calls such that there are no function calls within set amount of seconds |
| interval_rate_limiter | Splits time into intervals, and limits the number of function calls within each interval |
| default_value | Set default value for function if exception is raised |
| grid_search | Allow user to perform grid search on each iteration of function call |
| redirect | Enables user to redirect function stdout / stderr |
| crawler | Looks for function calls structure and displays it as a tree or nested lists |

## Additional Modules

### Iterative

- **loop**: On each call, function is performed n times and all outputs are returned in a list
- **average**: Function return mean value of n runs

### Plotting (matplotlib)

- **plot_multiple**: Creates a plot of a function's return values
- **plot_single**: Creates a plot of a function's return
