Pretty print for programming puzzles.

Highlights:

* Pretty print data structures and algorithms, especially sequence-oriented ones involving arrays such as lists, tuples and strs, and iterations, in the vein of leetcode and similar programming puzzles.
* Extensive configurability for various display styles and usage modes, such as console-interactive, animated, and more.
* Extensive use of [pre-commit](https://https://pre-commit.com/) hooks and unit-tests coverage to ensure correct functionality. Programming puzzles are hard enough to solve and debug, we shouldn't make it more error-prone by trying to use this library!


## Getting Started

To install from PyPI, use pip:

    pip install prettyalgo


See the [examples](./examples) sub-directory for examples showing the usage of the library.

Typical output when using on the terminal in interactive mode would like:
