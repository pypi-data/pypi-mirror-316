'''
A 'database' is a collection of information
that is often changing and needs to be accessed
and updated regularly.

The default database in Solar is FileDatabase,
which loads data from plaintext files in Solar's
assigned 'data' folder.

It acts as an abstraction layer to direct queries
to the correct "Collection" object and returns
the instantied object representing that kind of
data.

        # ones that inherit Collection. Then, it saves the

        # can be looked up based on the file's path.
