description = """
lxfx is a comprehensive library designed for time series analysis and experimentation. 
It simplifies the process by providing a suite of functionalities and stages, including data loading, 
various time series analysis techniques, and the implementation of advanced models such as LSTM, GRU, 
RNN, WaveNets, and Transformers. With lxfx, you can create a robust and efficient pipeline with just a 
few lines of code, making it an ideal tool for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field 
of time series analysis.
