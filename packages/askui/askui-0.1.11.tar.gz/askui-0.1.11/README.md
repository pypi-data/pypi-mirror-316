```
</details>


### 2. Install vision-agent in your Python environment

```shell
pip install askui
```

**Note:** Requires Python version >=3.10.

### 3a. Authenticate with an Automation Model Provider

|  | AskUI [INFO](https://app.askui.com/) | Anthropic [INFO](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) |
|----------|----------|----------|
| ENV Variables    | `ASKUI_WORKSPACE_ID`, `ASKUI_TOKEN`   | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`   |
| Supported Commands    | `click()`   | `click()`, `get()`, `act()`   |
| Description    | Faster Inference, European Server, Enterprise Ready   | Supports complex actions   |

To get started, set the environment variables required to authenticate with your chosen model provider.

#### How to set an environment variable?
<details>
  <summary>Linux & MacOS</summary>
  
  Use export to set an evironment variable:

  ```shell
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Windows PowerShell</summary>
  
  Set an environment variable with $env:

  ```shell
  $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="<your-api-key-here>"
  ```
</details>


### 3b. Test with 🤗 Hugging Face Model Demos

You can test the Vision Agent with Hugging Face models via their Spaces API. Please note that the API is rate-limited so for production use cases, it is recommended to choose step 3a.

**Note:** Hugging Face Spaces host model demos provided by individuals not associated with Hugging Face or AskUI. Don't use these models on screens with sensible information.

**Supported Models:**
- `AskUI/PTA-1`
- `OS-Copilot/OS-Atlas-Base-7B`
- `showlab/ShowUI-2B`
- `Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct`
- `Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct`

**Example Code:**
```python
agent.click("search field", model_name="OS-Copilot/OS-Atlas-Base-7B")
```


## ▶️ Start Building

```python
from askui import VisionAgent

# Initialize your agent context manager
with VisionAgent() as agent:
    # Use the webbrowser tool to start browsing
    agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("http://www.google.com")

    # Start to automate individual steps
    agent.click("url bar")
    agent.type("http://www.google.com")
    agent.keyboard("enter")

    # Extract information from the screen
    datetime = agent.get("What is the datetime at the top of the screen?")
    print(datetime)

    # Or let the agent work on its own
    agent.act("search for a flight from Berlin to Paris in January")
```

### 🎛️ Model Selection

Instead of relying on the default model for the entire automation script, you can specify a model for each `click` command using the `model_name` parameter.

|  | AskUI | Anthropic |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `click()`    | `askui-combo`, `askui-pta`, `askui-ocr`   | `anthropic-claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`   |

**Example:** `agent.click("Preview", model_name="askui-combo")`

### 🛠️ Direct Tool Use

Under the hood agents are using a set of tools. You can also directly access these tools.

#### Agent OS

The controller for the operating system.

```python
agent.tools.os.click("left", 2) # clicking
agent.tools.os.mouse(100, 100) # mouse movement
agent.tools.os.keyboard_tap("v", modifier_keys=["control"]) # Paste
# and many more
```

#### Web browser

The webbrowser tool powered by [webbrowser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html) allows you to directly access webbrowsers in your environment.

```python
agent.tools.webbrowser.open_new("http://www.google.com")
# also check out open and open_new_tab
```

#### Clipboard

The clipboard tool powered by [pyperclip](https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip) allows you to interact with the clipboard.

```python
agent.tools.clipboard.copy("...")
result = agent.tools.clipboard.paste()
```

### 📜 Logging & Reporting

You want a better understanding of what you agent is doing? Set the `log_level` to DEBUG. You can also generate a report of the automation run by setting `enable_report` to `True`.

```python
import logging

with VisionAgent(log_level=logging.DEBUG, enable_report=True) as agent:
    agent...
```

### 🖥️ Multi-Monitor Support

You have multiple monitors? Choose which one to automate by setting `display` to 1 or 2.

```python
with VisionAgent(display=1) as agent:
    agent...
```
