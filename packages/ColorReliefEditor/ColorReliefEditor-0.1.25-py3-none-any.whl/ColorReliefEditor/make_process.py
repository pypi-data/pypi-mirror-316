class MakeProcess(QObject):
    """
    Executes Makefile commands, streaming real-time output to an optional output window and
    emitting a `make_finished` signal upon completion. Supports dry-run mode to preview actions
    without execution and provides `build_required` to indicate if the dry-run determined that a
    build
    is required.

    Attributes:
        make_finished (pyqtSignal): Signal emitted when the make process finishes, with
            the job name and exit code.
        job_name (str): Name of the current job being processed.
        dry_run (bool): Specifies if the current process is a dry-run. Set to True if the
            make command ends with '-n'. Runs the process synchronously for analysis
            without actual execution.
        build_required (bool): Indicates whether a build is required based on the output
            of a dry-run. Set to True if any files or commands in the make process indicate
            a build is necessary, or if there is error output.
