<p>This tab manages settings for digital elevation files and configures the Coordinate Reference System (CRS).
    It will combine multiple elevation files if more than one file is specified.</p>
<p>The elevation file(s) are used for generating the Hillshade, Color image, and final Relief image.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Elevation Files:</b> This will be set when you drag a file to the blue box, or you can manually
        update it.
    </li>
    <li>You will need to run in expert mode to change the Coordinate Reference System from the default
        of epsg:3857.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p><b>Download Buttons:</b> These buttons will bring you to various websites for downloading digital elevation files.
</p>
<p>Once the files are downloaded, drag and drop them into the blue box. This will copy them to the project folder
    and automatically update the Elevation Files setting.</p>

        areas. Layer names cannot have a space in them.
