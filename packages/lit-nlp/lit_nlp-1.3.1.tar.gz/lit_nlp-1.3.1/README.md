# ðŸ”¥ Learning Interpretability Tool (LIT)

<!--* freshness: { owner: 'lit-dev' reviewed: '2024-06-25' } *-->

The Learning Interpretability Tool (ðŸ”¥LIT, formerly known as the Language
Interpretability Tool) is a visual, interactive ML model-understanding tool that
supports text, image, and tabular data. It can be run as a standalone server, or
inside of notebook environments such as Colab, Jupyter, and Google Cloud Vertex
AI notebooks.

LIT is built to answer questions such as:

*   **What kind of examples** does my model perform poorly on?
*   **Why did my model make this prediction?** Can this prediction be attributed
    to adversarial behavior, or to undesirable priors in the training set?
*   **Does my model behave consistently** if I change things like textual style,
    verb tense, or pronoun gender?

![Example of LIT UI](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/assets/images/readme-fig-1.png)

LIT supports a variety of debugging workflows through a browser-based UI.
Features include:

*   **Local explanations** via salience maps and rich visualization of model
    predictions.
*   **Aggregate analysis** including custom metrics, slicing and binning, and
    visualization of embedding spaces.
*   **Counterfactual generation** via manual edits or generator plug-ins to
    dynamically create and evaluate new examples.
*   **Side-by-side mode** to compare two or more models, or one model on a pair
    of examples.
*   **Highly extensible** to new model types, including classification,
    regression, span labeling, seq2seq, and language modeling. Supports
    multi-head models and multiple input features out of the box.
*   **Framework-agnostic** and compatible with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.

LIT has a [website](https://pair-code.github.io/lit) with live demos, tutorials,
a setup guide and more.

*   [Release notes](./RELEASE.md)

## Download and Installation

LIT can be installed via `pip` or built from source. Building from source is
necessary if you want to make code changes.

### Install from PyPI with pip

```sh
pip install lit-nlp
```

The default `pip` installation will install all required packages to use the LIT
Python API, built-in interpretability components, and web application. To
install dependencies for the provided demos or test suite, install LIT with the
appropriate optional dependencies.

```sh
# To install dependencies for the discriminative AI examples (GLUE, Penguin)
pip install 'lit-nlp[examples-discriminative-ai]'

# To install dependencies for the generative AI examples (Prompt Debugging)
pip install 'lit-nlp[examples-generative-ai]'

# To install dependencies for all examples plus the test suite
pip install 'lit-nlp[test]'
```

### Install from source

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit.git
cd lit
```

Note: be sure you are running Python 3.9+. If you have a different version on
your system, use the `conda` instructions below to set up a Python 3.9
environment.

Set up a Python environment with `venv` (or your preferred environment manager).
Note that these instructions assume you will be making code changes to LIT and
includes the full requirements for all examples and the test suite. See the
other optional dependency possibilities in the install with pip section.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
```

The LIT repo does not include a distributable version of the LIT app. You must
build it from source.

```sh
(cd lit_nlp; yarn && yarn build)
```

Note: if you see [an error](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2821)
running `yarn` on Ubuntu/Debian, be sure you have the
[correct version installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#linux-tab).

## Running LIT

Explore a collection of hosted demos on the
[demos page](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/demos).

### Using container images

See the [containerization guide](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/docker) for instructions on using LIT
locally in Docker, Podman, etc.

LIT also provides pre-built images that can take advantage of accelerators,
making Generative AI and LLM use cases easier to work with. Check out the
[LIT on GCP docs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/responsible-ai/lit-on-gcp)
for more.

### Quick-start: classification and regression

To explore classification and regression models tasks from the popular
[GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/):

```sh
python -m lit_nlp.examples.glue.demo --port=5432 --quickstart
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5432 to access the LIT UI.

Your default view will be a
[small BERT-based model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08962) fine-tuned on the
[Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html),
but you can switch to
[STS-B](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) or
[MultiNLI](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/) using the toolbar or the
gear icon in the upper right.

And navigate to http://localhost:5432 for the UI.

### Notebook usage

Colab notebooks showing the use of LIT inside of notebooks can be found at
[lit_nlp/examples/notebooks](./lit_nlp/examples/notebooks).

We provide a simple
[Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PAIR-code/lit/blob/main/lit_nlp/examples/notebooks/LIT_sentiment_classifier.ipynb).
Run all the cells to see LIT on an example classification model in the notebook.

### More Examples

See [lit_nlp/examples](./lit_nlp/examples). Most are run similarly to the
quickstart example above:

```sh
python -m lit_nlp.examples.<example_name>.demo --port=5432 [optional --args]
```

## User Guide

To learn about LIT's features, check out the [user guide](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/ui_guide), or
watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuRI_VK83dU).

## Adding your own models or data

You can easily run LIT with your own model by creating a custom `demo.py`
launcher, similar to those in [lit_nlp/examples](./lit_nlp/examples). The
basic steps are:

*   Write a data loader which follows the [`Dataset` API](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/api#datasets)
*   Write a model wrapper which follows the [`Model` API](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/api#models)
*   Pass models, datasets, and any additional
    [components](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/api#interpretation-components) to the LIT server class

For a full walkthrough, see
[adding models and data](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/api#adding-models-and-data).

## Extending LIT with new components

LIT is easy to extend with new interpretability components, generators, and
more, both on the frontend or the backend. See our [documentation](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/) to get
started.

## Pull Request Process

To make code changes to LIT, please work off of the `dev` branch and
[create pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
(PRs) against that branch. The `main` branch is for stable releases, and it is
expected that the `dev` branch will always be ahead of `main`.

[Draft PRs](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) are
encouraged, especially for first-time contributors or contributors working on
complex tasks (e.g., Google Summer of Code contributors). Please use these to
communicate ideas and implementations with the LIT team, in addition to issues.

Prior to sending your PR or marking a Draft PR as "Ready for Review", please run
the Python and TypeScript linters on your code to ensure compliance with
Google's [Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and
[TypeScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html) Style Guides.

```sh
# Run Pylint on your code using the following command from the root of this repo
(cd lit_nlp; pylint)

# Run ESLint on your code using the following command from the root of this repo
