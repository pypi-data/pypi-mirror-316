# <README/DATASET TITLE>

This is a bare minimum README template. It's primary use is to fool the BIDS validator into via testing and CI.

## Description

This dataset is most likely full of manufactured data. It is not intended to be used for anything other than testing.
If you are reading this and expecting to find real data, you are in the wrong place or someone failed to update this
file. It's most likely that after the validator signed off on this dataset that the user/curator moved on with their
life and forgot to update this file. Shame them for their laziness at the next available opportunity please.
