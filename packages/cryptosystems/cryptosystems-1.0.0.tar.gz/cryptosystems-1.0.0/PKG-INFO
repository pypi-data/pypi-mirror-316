## Overview
The `cryptosystems` package offers a robust suite of classes and functions for symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing algorithms, key exchange protocols as well as mathematical utility functions. Designed for seamless encryption, decryption, and cryptographic operations, this package is lightweight and efficient, relying solely on Python’s built-in libraries: `ctypes`, `warnings` and `hashlib`. With almost all of the cryptographic logic implemented from scratch, `cryptosystems` provides a streamlined, dependency-free solution, ensuring consistency and reliability across different environments as well as Python versions.

## Installation
To install the package, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install cryptosystems
```

## Usage

The general structure for usage is to create an object of the respective cryptosystem, with the key as argument if required. Similar usage for the utility functions as well. See [docs](https://cryptosystems.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the exact reference example of a specific cryptosystem if required.

```python
from cryptosystems import SomeCryptosystem

cipher = SomeCryptosystem()
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt("Hello World")
print(ciphertext)  # Output: 'ciphertext string'
plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
print(plaintext)  # Output: 'Hello World'
```
