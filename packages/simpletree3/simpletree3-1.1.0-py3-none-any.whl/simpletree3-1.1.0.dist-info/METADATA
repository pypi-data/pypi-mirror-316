              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Simpletree3 module
==================

Offers classes implementing basic tree-like
functionality, as well as iterators for walking
the trees and node search functionality. Requires Python3.4 or later.
Cython compilation is performed if cython is installed.

The design goal is to provide a basic class implementing the
essential tree structure and functionality. Practical applications will
want to inherit from one of the provided classes
in order to provide custom functionality. Tree walking
algorithms are implemented as generators, in order to
minimize the use of temporary objects and focus on
speed and efficiency.

Classes
-------

Two classes are provided: *SimpleNode* and
*FlexibleNode*.

SimpleNode
^^^^^^^^^^

This is the base class that provides the
tree node functionality by connecting
parents to children. Additional functionality
can be added by deriving from *SimpleNode*.

Each node is identified by a *key* parameter
of an arbitrary hashable type. Node keys must be unique
among the direct children of a node, since node
children are held in a dict using the key attribute as
dictionary keys (hence the hashable requirement).

Connections with nodes up and down the tree are
accessed through the parent and children properties
(children offers an iterator for the child nodes,
sorted by node key).
The root node of a tree is the node with parent
equal to None. Setting the parent of a node
checks that no loops are inserted and adds
the current node to the parent's children (if needed).
Deleting a parent sets it to None and removes
the node from the parent's children.

Some additional convenience properties are defined -
siblings, ancestors, depth, height - as well as
methods for adding and removing child nodes.

FlexibleNode
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a convenience class that add hooks to
setting and deleting a parent. The motivation for
providing it is that currently Python does not
offer a simple syntax for calling a base class
property from a derived class when that property is
overriden, so by inheriting from *FlexibleNode*
instead of *SimpleNode* one only has to override
the hooks to perform any desired operations.
Adding and deleting children can be
directly overriden, since they are not implemented
as properties. The design decision of having the
hook functionality implemented in a separate class
allows one to choose the trade-off between
speed and flexibility of tree building
(important for very large trees).


Iterators
---------

The module implements preorder, postorder, level
and leaf iterators. Each comes in two flavors - a simple
one, iterating through all nodes, and a filtered
one, where specific nodes can be selected
and/or specific subtrees can be ignored.

Search functionality
--------------------

The simplest search is done using a preorder iteration
procedure that yields nodes with the specified key.
A separate find function returns the first node matching
that key.

A common use case when building trees is that
subsequent nodes are added in a subtree containing the last
inserted node. To optimize for this case, a separate
search procedure is implemented, which walks up the
tree from the start node and searches for the
specified key in the subtree rooted in each ancestor.
