    Several features:
    1. A size threshold, below which each contour is counted as a single cell (or part of a single cell,
    in the case it is neighbor to boundary of the image)
    2. Above size threshold, the contour is seen as a cluster of cells an estimate of cell count is given
    based on the volume of the contour
    3. For cells on the boundary location, their estimated ncell is penalized according to the distance
    between the cell centroid and the boundary of the image; if the voxels of the cell do not touch
    edge, this penalty does not apply
    4. A min_size threshold, below (<=) which the contour is simply discarded because it's likely just
    an artifact
