    This function calculates the Fresnel reflection (r_s) and transmission (t_s) coefficients
    for s-polarized light (electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence) at the interface
    between two materials. The inputs are the refractive indices and the angles of incidence and
    refraction for the two layers.

    Args:
        _first_layer_n (Union[float, jnp.ndarray]): Refractive index of the first layer (incident medium).
            Can be a float or an array if computing for multiple incident angles/materials.
        _second_layer_n (Union[float, jnp.ndarray]): Refractive index of the second layer (transmitted medium).
            Similar to the first argument, this can also be a float or an array.
        _first_layer_theta (Union[float, jnp.ndarray]): Angle of incidence in the first layer (in radians).
