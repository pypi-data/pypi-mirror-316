# âœ¨ word-counter-AI âœ¨

Why would you want to count the words in simple, efficient and reliable way if u can use âœ¨AIâœ¨ for that

`word-counter-AI` isnâ€™t just another dull word-counting tool itâ€™s your golden ticket to âœ¨tech wizardryâœ¨! Fueled by Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.5 Flash model, it fearlessly takes on the Herculean challenge of counting words in a sentence.

Does it frequently (okay, fine mostly) mess up the numbers? Absolutely. But who cares when your code looks like itâ€™s been pulled straight from a B-grade sci-fi flick? To the tech-illiterate masses, it screams innovation! (Think Idiocracy, but with better branding).

Because letâ€™s face it, coding isnâ€™t always about solving problems itâ€™s about looking like youâ€™ve hacked the Matrix and are sipping martinis on a neon-lit hovercraft. Toss in a dash of "AI magic," and watch as people marvel at your âœ¨geniusâœ¨. Efficiency is overrated anyway what really matters is âœ¨vibesâœ¨. ðŸ˜‰
