=========================================

"fastcap2" is an Python module providing a Python interface for the FastCap engine.

This project includes some major refactoring with following goals:

* Port to modern language standards
* Encapsulate data for Python object binding
* Release memory after solver object end of life
* Remove global and static variables to enable concurrent execution
* Programmatic geometry generation API

FastCap is the premium capacitance solver originally developed at M.I.T. on Unix platform. A de-facto golden reference standard, FastCap extracts the capacitances of any 3D conductive geometry in free space or embedded in arbitrary, piecewise-constant dielectrics, by solving the Maxwell equations in quasi-static regime.


This repository contains the source code, in three separated branches.


The 'master' branch contains the original FastCap distribution from M.I.T.
Remark: in this branch the original 'README' file has been renamed 'README.mit'. Refer to the README.mit file for further details on this branch.

The 'WinMSVS' branch contains the FastCap2 code.  FastCap2 is the FastFieldSolvers S.R.L. Windows porting of FastCap, including a GUI. It compiles under the free for open source projects MS Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition (for exact details about MS VS2013 licensing please refer to its terms and conditions from MicroSoft)

The 'WRCad' branch contains the FastCap porting made by Whiteley Research Inc. (http://www.wrcad.com/). It supports some minor enhancements and fixes. Code compiles for Linux 32/64 bits as well as for Windows in shell only mode, using MinGW.

Access to the download pages is free, and you may access anonymously if you want.
