              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

[![Optimum TPU / Test TGI on TPU](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-tpu/actions/workflows/test-pytorch-xla-tpu-tgi.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-tpu/actions/workflows/test-pytorch-xla-tpu-tgi.yml)
</div>

[Tensor Processing Units (TPU)](https://cloud.google.com/tpu) are AI accelerator made by Google to optimize
performance and cost from AI training to inference.

This repository exposes an interface similar to what Hugging Face transformers library provides to interact with
a magnitude of models developed by research labs, institutions and the community.

We aim at providing our user the best possible performances targeting Google Cloud TPUs for both training and inference
working closely with Google and Google Cloud to make this a reality.


## Supported Model and Tasks

We currently support a few LLM models targeting text generation scenarios:
- 💎 Gemma (2b, 7b)
- 🦙 Llama2 (7b) and Llama3 (8b). On Text Generation Inference with Jetstream Pytorch, also Llama3.1, Llama3.2 and Llama3.3 (text-only models) are supported, up to 70B parameters.
- 💨 Mistral (7b)


## Installation

`optimum-tpu` comes with an handy PyPi released package compatible with your classical python dependency management tool.

`pip install optimum-tpu -f https://storage.googleapis.com/libtpu-releases/index.html`

`export PJRT_DEVICE=TPU`


## Inference

`optimum-tpu` provides a set of dedicated tools and integrations in order to leverage Cloud TPUs for inference, especially
on the latest TPU version `v5e` and `v6e`.

Other TPU versions will be supported along the way.

### Text-Generation-Inference

As part of the integration, we do support a [text-generation-inference (TGI)](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-tpu/tree/main/text-generation-inference) backend allowing to deploy and serve
incoming HTTP requests and execute them on Cloud TPUs.

Please see the [TGI specific documentation](text-generation-inference) on how to get started.

### JetStream Pytorch Engine

`optimum-tpu` provides an optional support of JetStream Pytorch engine inside of TGI. This support can be installed using the dedicated CLI command:

```shell
optimum-tpu install-jetstream-pytorch
```

To enable the support, export the environment variable `JETSTREAM_PT=1`.

## Training

Fine-tuning is supported and tested on the TPU `v5e`. We have tested so far:

- 🦙 Llama-2 7B, Llama-3 8B and newer;
- 💎 Gemma 2B and 7B.

You can check the examples:

- [Fine-Tune Gemma on Google TPU](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-tpu/blob/main/examples/language-modeling/gemma_tuning.ipynb)
- The [Llama fine-tuning script](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-tpu/blob/main/examples/language-modeling/llama_tuning.ipynb)
