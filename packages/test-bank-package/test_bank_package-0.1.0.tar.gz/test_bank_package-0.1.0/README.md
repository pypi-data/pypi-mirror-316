# This is a workshop for publishing a custom package to pypi using uv

Here, we use python uv as a package manager and we build a custom package and publish to pypi.  

Below are what we do:
- create function to add only a positive-and-non-zero number
- create unit testing including: happy path, non-list, negative, zero
- build and publish to pypi
