# ipsh

_Python library providing a shell-like interface in pure Python,
supporting limited in-line editing and History on Unix and Windows systems._

Built around the `getch()` and `getkey()` functions from
<https://gitlab.com/MatteoCampinoti94/PythonRead>
(and originally forked from that repository).
