# Learning Purpose

Besides its main job, this repo intends to teach aspiring data analysts or even data scientists who cannot have full control over their coding cycle. With a simple mission: create visualizations and append them in one interactive report, you can take your learning curve up to include useful skills:
* Write unit and integration tests with edge cases to ensure your code is not error-prone.

* Write CI/CD workflows to run on every push or pull request to ensure the newly committed code is compatible enough.

* Creating, managing and deploying your packaged code to PyPi so that you can simply run `pip install <package_name>` and start using it.
