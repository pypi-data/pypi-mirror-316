    Usually a domain object publish an event and the data from that event is processed
    and sent to external system using a publisher. But sometimes the data needs to be
    published just after it is processed. In such cases, the domain object can use a 
    callback object to process the data and publish it immediately.

    Callbacks should be injected into the aggregate's methods to allow it to process
    data and communicate their results to the message publisher.

    When a callback is passed to an aggregate's it shouldn't know that a complex comunication
    object is being used. It should just call the callback object as if it were a function.
