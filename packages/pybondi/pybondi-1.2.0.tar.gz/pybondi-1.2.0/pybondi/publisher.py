        payload: The payload of the message.
        sender: The identifier of the entity that sends the message.
        id: A unique identifier for the message.

class Base(ABC):
    """
    An abstract base class for a publisher.

    A publisher is responsible for publishing messages to external systems
    using callable subscribers. Implementations of this class should ensure
    transactional consistency and proper resource management by providing
    concrete definitions for the `begin`, `commit`, `rollback`, and `close`
    methods.
    
    The key distinction between a publisher and a message bus is:
    - **Publisher**: Sends data from within a bounded context to external systems.
    - **Message Bus**: Routes events and commands within the bounded context
      and ensures they are handled within a transaction.

    Messages passed to the publisher should be serializable objects, such as strings,
    dictionaries, or JSON-encoded data.
    
    Methods:
    - `publish`: Publishes a message to a specified topic.
    - `begin`: Starts a new transaction.
    - `commit`: Commits the current transaction to persist changes.
    - `rollback`: Rolls back the current transaction to its previous state.
    - `close`: Closes the publisher, releasing resources and connections.

        This method should be implemented by a concrete subclass to define the
        logic for publishing messages to the external system (e.g., a message queue,
        a Kafka topic, or an HTTP endpoint).

        Args:
            `topic` (str): The topic, channel, or queue to which the message should be published.
            `message` (Any): The message to be published. The message should be a serializable 
                           object (e.g., string, dictionary, or JSON).
