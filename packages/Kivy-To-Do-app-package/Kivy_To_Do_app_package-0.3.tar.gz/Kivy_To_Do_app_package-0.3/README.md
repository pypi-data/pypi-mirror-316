# Kivy To Do app
## What is "Kivy To Do app"?
<p>The app is exactly what the title says, it is a simple to do app made with Kivy(multiplatform naturaly resizable framework) and .json</p>
<p>All the basic features like adding or deleting tasks, or adding dates to the tasks are in, however it is not complete yet, features like ordering tasks based on the importance are not done yet.</p>
<p>I am currently learning Kivy through these small apps, so pardon me if the code doesnt look the best.</p>
