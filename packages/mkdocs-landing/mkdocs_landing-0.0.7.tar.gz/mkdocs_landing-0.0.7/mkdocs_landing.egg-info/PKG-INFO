Landing is an mkdocs theme geared towards making a personal landing page, with simpler navigation and heavily customisable style options.

# Configuration
With Landing I've tried to expose as much of the styling as possible to mkdocs, so that you can change up the theme to your own personal style as much as possible. Of course, there's nothing more flexible than writing your own css, so if you hit a wall with the config file I've also tried to make the html as simple as possible so you can easily add your own custom CSS.

# History
Landing came out of me wanting to use mkdocs for [my own personal landing page](https://teparsons.github.io/mkdocs-landing#todd-parsons) - I made a custom .css file to sit alongside a generic mkdocs file and style it the way I wanted it. When implementing a [similar page for a friend](https://teparsons.github.io/mkdocs-landing#ben-ambrose) I realised that this basic structure could be fairly easily modified with a few key parameters to match a variety of different aesthetics.

# Installation
Landing is [mirrored on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-landing/) and can be installed via pip:

`pip install mkdocs-landing`
