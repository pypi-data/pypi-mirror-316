**Purpose:**
The purpose of the Customer Journey Orchestration package is to seamlessly connect and track customer interactions across multiple marketing channels, enabling businesses to gain a holistic view of each customerâ€™s experience over time. By orchestrating touchpoints across channels, the package empowers marketers to deliver personalized, timely, and relevant messages, optimize engagement, and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. It helps create a unified, data-driven strategy for nurturing and guiding customers through their journey, ultimately driving conversions and business growth.

**Requirements packages:**

**NumPy** - Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. <br>
**python-dateutil** - Provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module. <br>
**dask**    - Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytics. See documentation for more information. <br>                            
**random**  - generate random numbers with in the set limits.  <br>
**pandas**  -  Dataframe utility. <br>


**Installation Instructions:**

pip install journey-orchestrate

**Example**

|   ID | Timestamp           | Channel     | <br>
|-----:|:--------------------|:------------| <br>
|    1 | 2024-11-18 08:00:00 | email       | <br>
|    1 | 2024-11-18 09:00:00 | sms         | <br>
|    3 | 2024-11-18 10:00:00 | app         | <br>
|    3 | 2024-11-18 11:00:00 | email       | <br>
|    5 | 2024-11-18 12:00:00 | sms         | <br>
|    5 | 2024-11-18 15:00:00 | direct mail | <br>

**Output.** <br>
1  email > sms <br>
3  app > email <br>
5  sms > direct mail <br>

For a customer journey involving multiple marketing channels through which messages were delivered, we can orchestrate and stitch together the individual journey paths for each customer, providing a cohesive view of their interactions across all touchpoints.


How to use it :
There are two main functions of this framework.

**1. customer_journey_orchestrate(data, ID, datetime,channel,join_string ,n_partitions)**

- This is the main functionionility for customer journey orchestration .
    1st parameter -  dataframe where the customer touch point exists. <br>
    2nd parameter -  ID on which data should be grouped. <br> 
    3rd parameter -  timestamp on which we should start. <br>
    4th parameter -  column on which customer journey should be orchestrated . eg: Email, Directmail, Paid display, social media, etc.<br>
    5th parameter -  Join string. for eg: '>','|',etc. if nothing is given, default is '>'.<br>
    6th parameter -  number of partitions in which dask would operate the data for sorting.<br>



**2. generate_random_data(n,nc,startdt, enddt,channel_lst,random_seed)**

- This would generate sample dataset to test the customer journey orchestrate function

   1st parameter - Number of rows to generate. <br>
   2nd parameter - Number of unique IDs you want in the dataset
   3rd parameter - Start date. <br>
   4th parameter - End date. <br>
   5th parameter - Unique Channel list : eg:['EM','SMC','PD','PS']. <br>
   6th parameter - random_seed. <br>


**How to test the package with out data ?** 

**Step1** - Run with  "generate_random_data" by passing appropriate values 

eg: df_example = generate_random_data(1000,30,"2023-01-01",'2024-10-01',['EM','Direct Mail','Paid Display','Search'],230).


**Step2** - Run the orchestrator function  customer_journey_orchestrate(data, ID, datetime,channel,join_string ,n_partitions)

eg:  customer_journey_orchestrate(df_example, 'ID', 'time','channel','>' ,2)
