    Compute geodesic distance from one vertex to the entire surface.
    
    Unless -limit is specified, computes the geodesic distance from the
    specified vertex to all others. The result is output as a single column
    metric file, with a value of -1 for vertices that the distance was not
    computed for.
    
    The -corrected-areas option should be used when the input is a group average
    surface - group average surfaces have significantly less surface area than
    individual surfaces do, and therefore distances measured on them would be
    smaller than measuring them on individual surfaces. In this case, the input
    to this option should be a group average of the output of
    -surface-vertex-areas for each subject.
    
    If -naive is not specified, the algorithm uses not just immediate neighbors,
    but also neighbors derived from crawling across pairs of triangles that
    share an edge.

    Args:

        vertex: the vertex to compute geodesic distance from.
        metric_out: the output metric.
        opt_naive: use only neighbors, don't crawl triangles (not recommended).

            at.
