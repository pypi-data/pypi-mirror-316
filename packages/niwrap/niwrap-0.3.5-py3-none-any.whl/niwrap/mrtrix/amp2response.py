    Estimate response function coefficients based on the DWI signal in single-fibre
    voxels.
    
    This command uses the image data from all selected single-fibre voxels
    concurrently, rather than simply averaging their individual spherical
    harmonic coefficients. It also ensures that the response function is
    non-negative, and monotonic (i.e. its amplitude must increase from the fibre
    direction out to the orthogonal plane).
    
    If multi-shell data are provided, and one or more b-value shells are not
    explicitly requested, the command will generate a response function for
    every b-value shell (including b=0 if present).

    Args:
        amps: the amplitudes image.
        mask: the mask containing the voxels from which to estimate the\
            response function.
        directions_: a 4D image containing the estimated fibre directions.
        response: the output zonal spherical harmonic coefficients.
        isotropic: estimate an isotropic response function (lmax=0 for all\
            shells).
        noconstraint: disable the non-negativity and monotonicity constraints.
        directions: provide an external text file containing the directions\
            along which the amplitudes are sampled.
        shells: specify one or more b-values to use during processing, as a\
            comma-separated list of the desired approximate b-values (b-values are\
            clustered to allow for small deviations). Note that some commands are\
            incompatible with multiple b-values, and will report an error if more\
            than one b-value is provided.\
            WARNING: note that, even though the b=0 volumes are never referred\
            to as shells in the literature, they still have to be explicitly\
            included in the list of b-values as provided to the -shell option!\
            Several algorithms which include the b=0 volumes in their\
            computations may otherwise return an undesired result.
        lmax: specify the maximum harmonic degree of the response function to\
            estimate (can be a comma-separated list for multi-shell data).
        info: display information messages.
        quiet: do not display information messages or progress status;\
            alternatively, this can be achieved by setting the MRTRIX_QUIET\
            environment variable to a non-empty string.
        debug: display debugging messages.
        force: force overwrite of output files (caution: using the same file as\
            input and output might cause unexpected behaviour).
        nthreads: use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications\
            (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).
        config: temporarily set the value of an MRtrix config file entry.
        help_: display this information page and exit.
        version: display version information and exit.
        runner: Command runner.
    Returns:
        NamedTuple of outputs (described in `Amp2responseOutputs`).
