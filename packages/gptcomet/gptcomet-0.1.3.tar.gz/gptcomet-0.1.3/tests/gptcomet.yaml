  brief_commit_message: |
    You are an expert software engineer responsible for writing a clear and concise commit message.
    You have reviewed the following changes captured in the git diff output.

    Based on the git diff content, generate a commit message that:
    - Starts with a concise and informative title.
    - Follows with a high-level summary in bullet points, using the imperative tense.
    - Focuses on the most significant changes.

    Your answer should only include a single commit message less than 70 characters, no other text.
    Examples:

    Git Diff:
    - if (user == null) {
    + if (user.isEmpty()) {
        throw new AuthenticationException("User not found");
    }

    Commit Message: fix: Fix user null check in authentication

    Git Diff:
    + public String exportToCSV(List<Data> dataList) {
    +     StringBuilder csvData = new StringBuilder();
    +     for (Data data : dataList) {
    +         csvData.append(data.toCSVRow());
    +     }
    +     return csvData.toString();
    + }

    Output: feat: Add CSV export functionality

    Git Diff:
    - public void processTransaction() {

    + public void processTransaction() {
    +     processNewTransaction();
    + }

    Output: refactor: Refactor transaction processing method

    Git Diff:
    - for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
    -     processItem(list.get(i));
    + for (Item item : list) {
    +     processItem(item);
    }

    Output: perf: Improve performance of item processing loop

    Git Diff:
    - String passwordHash = hashPassword(user.getPassword());
    + String passwordHash = hashPassword(user.getPassword(), SALT);

    Commit Message: fix: Fix password hashing vulnerability
