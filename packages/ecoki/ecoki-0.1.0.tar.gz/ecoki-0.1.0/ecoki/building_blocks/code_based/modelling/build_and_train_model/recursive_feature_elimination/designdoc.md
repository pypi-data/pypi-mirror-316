Design Document for Pytest of Recursive Feature Elimination Module

==================================================================

Objective

---

The primary objective of this design document is to outline the testing strategy for the `recursive_feature_elimination` module. The tests will ensure that the module functions correctly and efficiently across a variety of scenarios.

Scope

---

The tests will cover:

1. Initialization of the RecursiveFeatureElimination class.
2. Execution of the feature elimination process.
3. Validation of the output against expected results.
4. Handling of edge cases and erroneous inputs.

Components to Test

---

1. **Initialization**: Test the correct initialization of the RecursiveFeatureElimination class with necessary parameters.
2. **Feature Elimination Process**:

   - Test the feature elimination logic to ensure that it correctly identifies and eliminates features.
   - Ensure that the process respects the parameters provided (e.g., number of features to select, step size).
3. **Output Validation**:

   - Verify that the output is a reduced feature set of the expected size.
   - Check the correctness of the selected features based on known data.
4. **Error Handling**:

   - Test the response to invalid inputs such as incorrect data types or invalid parameter values.
   - Ensure appropriate exceptions are raised.

Test Cases

---

1. **Test Initialization**:

   - Test with correct parameters.
   - Test with missing parameters to check if defaults are set.
   - Test with invalid parameters to check if errors are raised.
2. **Test Feature Elimination Process**:

   - Test with a synthetic dataset where the importance of features is known.
   - Test with different step sizes and number of features to select.
   - Test with the minimum and maximum allowable values for parameters.
3. **Test Output Validation**:

   - Compare the output feature set with the expected feature set.
   - Ensure the output feature set size matches the requested size.
4. **Test Error Handling**:

   - Pass data with incorrect types (e.g., passing a list instead of a DataFrame).
   - Provide parameters outside the acceptable range and expect errors.

Tools and Libraries

---

- Pytest for writing and running the tests.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and validation.
- Mocking libraries (e.g., unittest.mock) to simulate the behavior of dependencies.

Execution Plan

---

1. Implement the test cases as functions using pytest.
2. Use fixtures for setup and teardown to manage test data and environment.
3. Run the tests using the pytest command-line tool.
4. Review test outcomes and adjust tests or module code as necessary.

Conclusion

---

This design document provides a structured approach to testing the `recursive_feature_elimination` module. By following this plan, we can ensure the module is robust, efficient, and behaves as expected under various conditions.
