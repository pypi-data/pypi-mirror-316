<b><u>Module: TrainAndPredictXGBoost</u></b>

The module is designed to perform hyperparameter tuning (if the size of the dataset is large, i.e., greater than 10,000 records) using GridSearchCV, train an XGBoost regression model on the input data, predict values on the test set (20% of the dataset), and calculate the mean average error (MAE) between the predicted and actual values.

######

## Short description

The TrainAndPredictXGBoost class encapsulates a powerful gradient boosting algorithm called XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). This algorithm is renowned for its high efficiency, flexibility, and great accuracy in many regression and classification tasks.

XGBoost creates an ensemble of decision trees, trained sequentially, with each new tree trying to correct the mistakes of its predecessors. It uses the principles of gradient boosting, where new models add value by reducing the residuals of the prior models, hence driving the ensemble towards the true prediction. XGBoost also includes a variety of regularization techniques that control over-fitting, making it a robust and well-performing model.

If the size of the dataset is large (>10k records), the class leverages the GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. GridSearchCV systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validates as it goes to determine which tune gives the best performance.

The trained model is then used to make predictions on a test dataset and calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - a measure of prediction error.
## inputs
### Necessary:
- "input_data": A list of pandas DataFrames. The list should contain four elements in the following order: x_train, x_valid, y_train, y_valid.

### Optional:
none

## exits
In case of any exceptions during the model training, prediction, or MAE calculation, None is returned and a status code of 1 is set on the output port.

### Expected results:
The output of this module is a pandas DataFrame containing the actual and predicted values from the test dataset.

### Output format:
The output format is a pandas DataFrame.

## parameters
There are no parameters to set in the settings.json file for this module.
