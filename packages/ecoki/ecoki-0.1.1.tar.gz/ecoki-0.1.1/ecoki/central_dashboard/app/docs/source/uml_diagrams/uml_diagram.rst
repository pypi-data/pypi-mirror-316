   The UML diagram above is a placeholder. The actual diagram will be added in a future update to provide a comprehensive overview of the EcoKI architecture.

Key Components
--------------

The UML diagram, once completed, will illustrate the following key components of the EcoKI architecture:

1. Pipeline Manager
2. Building Blocks
3. Data Integration modules
4. Modeling modules
5. Evaluation and Optimization components
6. User Interface and Dashboard

Component Relationships
-----------------------

The diagram will also showcase the relationships and interactions between these components, including:

- How the Pipeline Manager orchestrates the execution of Building Blocks
- Data flow between different modules
- Integration points with external systems and data sources
- Feedback loops for model optimization and evaluation

This visual representation will aid developers and users in understanding the overall structure and workflow of the EcoKI system.
