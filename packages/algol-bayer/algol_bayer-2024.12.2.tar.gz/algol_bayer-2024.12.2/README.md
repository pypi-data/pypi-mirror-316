#  Capture, display and convert RAW DSLR astronomical images

This package was developed for astro-spectroscopic student projects
at the Dresden GÃ¶nnsdorf observatory.

There are method to 
* [Capture DSLR raw images](#capture-dslr-raw-images)
* [Display raw DSLR images and spectra](#display-raw-dslr-images-and-spectra)
* [Display fits images and spectra](#display-fits-images-and-spectra)
* [Dark and flat correction](#dark-and-flat-correction)
* [Debayer a 2d into a 3d fits file](#debayer-a-2d-into-a-3d-fits-file)

## Installation

    apt-get install gphoto2
    pip install algol-bayer

## Capture DSLR raw images

### Capture and display as histograms

Capture a sequence of DSLR raw images using increasing exposure times
and [display the images as histogram](#display-raw-dslr-image-as-histogram).

    bayer_capture_histograms.sh

### Capture and display as spectra

Capture a sequence of DSLR raw images and try to
[display them as spectra](#display-raw-dslr-image-as-spectrum).

    bayer_capture_sequence.sh 

## Display raw DSLR images and spectra

### Display raw DSLR image as histogram

    bayer_display_histogram --help

### Display raw DSLR image as spectrum

There is a published paper explaining how this works. 
It can be found online or in the `docs/article` folder.

## Dark and flat correction

An example of how to do this can be found in `tests/test_darkflat.py`

### Create master dark

... or a master-flat-dark from a set of dark images.

    fits_create_master_dark --help

### Create master flat

... from a master-flat-dark and a set of flat images. 

    fits_create_master_flat --help

### Apply master dark and master flat to light images

    fits_apply_darks_and_flats --help

## Conversions

### Debayer a 2d into a 3d fits file

    fits_debayer --help
