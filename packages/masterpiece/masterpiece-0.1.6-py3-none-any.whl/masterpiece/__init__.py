"""
This module exposes the core concrete classes of the framework, which are intended to be 
instantiated and used by application developers. 

The core package consists of two types of classes:

1. **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**: These define the interfaces that framework implementors should 
    follow when creating subclasses. They provide method contracts that must be implemented by concrete 
    subclasses. These classes are **not intended to be instantiated** directly.

2. **Concrete Classes**: These are the classes that **can be instantiated** and used directly by application 
    developers. They represent fully implemented functionality and are ready for use in applications.

### Convention:
- The **abstract base classes** serve as blueprints for framework developers to implement and extend. 
    They should not be directly instantiated by application developers.
- The **concrete classes** are the ones exposed in this module and listed in `__all__`. These are the 
    classes that application developers will typically interact with, as they provide fully implemented,
    ready-to-use features.

### `__all__` Declaration:
- The `__all__` list includes only the concrete classes, making it clear which classes are meant to be 
    instantiated and used by application developers.
- Abstract base classes are excluded from `__all__` to ensure they are not instantiated directly, 
    which maintains clarity and proper separation of concerns.

### Usage:
- **Framework Implementors**: Should inherit from the abstract base classes and implement the necessary methods.
- **Application Developers**: Should use the concrete classes listed in `__all__` for their applications.

This structure ensures clear separation between the framework's core functionality and the classes that can be
used to build applications on top of the framework.
