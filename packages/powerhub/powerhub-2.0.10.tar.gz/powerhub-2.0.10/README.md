PowerHub
========

PowerHub is a convenient post exploitation tool for PowerShell which aids a
pentester in transferring data, in particular code which may get flagged by
endpoint protection. Features:

* Fileless
* Stateless
* Cert pinning
* String "obfuscation" by RC4 encryption
* Choose your AMSI Bypass
* Transparent aliases for in-memory execution of C# programs

During an engagement where you have a test client available, one of the
first things you want to do is run SharpHound, Seatbelt, PowerUp,
Invoke-PrivescCheck or PowerSploit. So you need to download the files,
mess with endpoint protection, disable the execution policy, etc.
PowerHub provides an (almost) one-click-solution for this. Oh, and you can
also run arbitrary binaries (PE and shell code) entirely in-memory using
PowerSploit's modules, which is sometimes useful to bypass application
whitelisting.

Your loot (Kerberos tickets, passwords, etc.) can be easily transferred back
either as a file or a text snippet, via the command line or the web
interface. PowerHub also helps with collaboration in case you're a small
team.

Here is a simple example (grab information about local groups with PowerView
and transfer it back):
