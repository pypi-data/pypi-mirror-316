    r'''
    A tool function for cross-validations, to divide the training set and the test set. It is suitable for subject dependent experiments with large dataset volume and no need to use k-fold cross-validations. For the first step, the EEG signal samples of the specified user are selected. Then, parts of trials are sampled according to a certain proportion as the test dataset, and samples from other trials are used as training samples. In most literatures, 20% of the data are sampled for testing.

    Args:
        dataset (BaseDataset): Dataset to be divided.
        test_size (int):  If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. If int, represents the absolute number of test samples. (default: :obj:`0.2`)
        subject (str): The subject whose EEG samples will be used for training and test. (default: :obj:`s01.dat`)
        shuffle (bool): Whether to shuffle the data before splitting into batches. Note that the samples within each split will not be shuffled. (default: :obj:`False`)
        random_state (int, optional): When shuffle is :obj:`True`, :obj:`random_state` affects the ordering of the indices, which controls the randomness of each fold. Otherwise, this parameter has no effect. (default: :obj:`None`)
        split_path (str): The path to data partition information. If the path exists, read the existing partition from the path. If the path does not exist, the current division method will be saved for next use. If set to None, a random path will be generated. (default: :obj:`None`)
