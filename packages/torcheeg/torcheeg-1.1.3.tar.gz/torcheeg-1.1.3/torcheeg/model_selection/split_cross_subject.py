    r'''
    A tool function for cross-validations, to divide the training set and the test set across subjects. It is suitable for experiments with large dataset volume and no need to use k-fold cross-validations. A certain proportion of subjects are sampled as the test dataset, and samples from other subjects are used as training samples. In most literatures, 20% of the subjects are sampled for testing.

    :obj:`train_test_split_cross_subject` divides training set and the test set at the dimension of subjects. For example, when :obj:`test_size=0.2`, 80% of subjects are used for training, and 20% of subjects are used for testing. It is more consistent with real applications and can test the generalization of the model across different subjects.

    Args:
        dataset (BaseDataset): Dataset to be divided.
        test_size (float):  Should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion of the subjects to include in the test split. (default: :obj:`0.2`)
        shuffle (bool): Whether to shuffle the subjects before splitting. (default: :obj:`False`)
        label_transform (Callable, optional): Function that returns the stratified label for each sample. If set to None, it will not be stratified. (default: :obj:`None`)
        random_state (int, optional): When shuffle is :obj:`True`, :obj:`random_state` affects the ordering of the subjects, which controls the randomness of the split. Otherwise, this parameter has no effect. (default: :obj:`None`)
        split_path (str): The path to data partition information. If the path exists, read the existing partition from the path. If the path does not exist, the current division method will be saved for next use. If set to None, a random path will be generated. (default: :obj:`None`)
