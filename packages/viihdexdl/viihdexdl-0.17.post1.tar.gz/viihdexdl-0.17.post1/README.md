# ViihdexDL

A command line tool for downloading HLS streams with multiple audio and subtitle tracks (designed especially for Elisa Viihde recordings) using FFmpeg.

## Requirements
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and libraries [langcodes](https://pypi.org/project/langcodes/) and [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) are required.

[FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) is needed to download streams.

## Settings
Download settings are defined in settings.ini which in Windows systems is located in `%APPDATA%\viihdexdl`.  Preferred languages are set using two-letter ISO 639-1 or three-letter ISO 639-2 [codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
```
audio languages:      Languages of audio tracks to be downloaded.
                      If left empty, all available tracks are downloaded.
subtitle languages:   Languages of subtitle tracks to be downloaded.
                      If left empty, all available tracks are downloaded.
default audio:        Languages of the audio tracks for which 'default' flag can be set. Preferably
                      the track with the language listed first is flagged, but if no track of that
                      language is downloaded then the second listed is checked etc.
default subtitle:     Languages of the audio tracks for which 'default' flag can be set.
visual impaired:      Language of the audio track for which 'visual impaired' flag
                      is set (only works with .mkv files).
hearing impaired:     Language of the subtitle track for which 'hearing impaired' flag
                      is set (onlyworks with .mkv files).
maximum bandwidth:    The variant with the highest bitrate below this limit (bit/s) is downloaded.
                      If left empty or set to 0, the best variant is downloaded.
maximum width:        Maximum width (pixels) for video.
maximum height:       Maximum height (pixels) for video.
file extension:       File extension of the output file. Use mkv (preferred) or mp4.
external subtitles    Download subtitles to external files.
rfc 5646 to iso 639:  Convert RFC 5646 language (e.g. nl-NL) tags to ISO 639-1/2 language codes.
iso 639:              Type of language codes to use in metadata.
                      Use alpha_2 (nl), alpha_3 (nld) or alpha_3b (dut).
ffmpeg options:       FFmpeg global and input options.
ffmpeg video codec:   FFmpeg video codec options.
ffmpeg audio codec:   FFmpeg audio codec options.
