Configuration
=============

By default, tax information related to sale order lines is always shown in sale orders PDFs. If it needs to be hidden along with the pricing information in sale order lines, you need to go to Sales > Configuration > Settings. Under the "Pricing" section, activate the "Hide Taxes" options. If the option is activated, there are two possible scenarios:

* Pricing information for a sale order line is shown in a sale order PDF. Tax information is displayed.
* Pricing information for a sale order line is hidden in sale orders PDF. Tax information is hidden.

In other words, if the "Hide Taxes" option is deactivated, tax information is shown for all sale order line, whether the sale order line shows its pricing information or not. If the option is activated, the tax information is only hidden in sale order line that have their pricing information hidden.

Usage
=====

* To hide the pricing information in PDFs for all the sale order lines you need to click on the "Hide Lines Price Info in Report" button above sale order lines.
* To display the pricing information in PDFs for all the sale order lines you need to click on the "Show Lines Price Info in Report" button above sale order lines.
* Each sale order line has a checkbox to set whether the princing information needs to be shown or hidden for that specific line.

*Note. If the "Hide Taxes" option is activated in sales general settings, taxes will be hidden in sale order lines for which the princing information is hidden*
