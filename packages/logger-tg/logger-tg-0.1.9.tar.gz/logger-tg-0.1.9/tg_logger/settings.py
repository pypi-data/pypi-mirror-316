    Configures global logger settings with the provided Telegram bot token and
        recipient ID.
    This function initializes the global `logger_settings` variable with
        an instance of `TgLoggerSettings`.

    Parameters:
    - bot_token (str): The Telegram bot token.
    - recipient_id (int): The Telegram recipient ID.

    This configuration allows the `BaseLogger` to use these settings by default, eliminating the need to
    pass them explicitly during its initialization if they are already configured here.
