SALT3 training code
===================

This repo is a refactoring of the SALT training code
for modeling Type Ia supernovae, originally developed by J. Guy.
When using the SALT3 model, please cite arXiv 2104.07795 (<em>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07795</em>).

We are also developing an additional testing and simulation framework.
Please feel free to message us with any questions and see
