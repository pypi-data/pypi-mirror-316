====================
Zinc Python bindings
====================

Zinc provides Python bindings to the visualisation library.
There are some examples available at https://cmlibs.org/documentation/tutorials/index.html.
A typical usage often starts with creating a Context like this::

 from cmlibs.zinc import context
 c = context.Context.create("my-context")

There are some very cool things you can visualize with this library, like DICOM images, Hermite meshes and so on.

First Steps
===========

The examples are the best place for getting started with Zinc Python bindings.
