# Jaya Optimization Algorithm

The **JayaOptimizer** is a Python library that implements the Jaya Optimization Algorithm, a population-based optimization technique. It is designed to solve continuous, discrete, and mixed-variable optimization problems efficiently.

---

## Features

- Supports continuous, discrete, and mixed-variable optimization.
- User-friendly interface for defining objective functions and constraints.
- Handles maximization and minimization problems.
- Tracks convergence history for analysis.
- Automatically adapts to user-defined variable boundaries.

---

## Installation

Install the library using pip:
```bash
pip install jaya-optimizer
=======
# jaya-optimizer
The Jaya algorithm is a metaheuristic which is capable of solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. It is a population based method which repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. It is a gradient-free optimization algorithm.
