# SnapGPT üì∏

SnapGPT is a command-line utility that creates a single, well-organized snapshot of your codebase. It's especially handy for sharing your project context with AI coding assistants (like ChatGPT) while keeping your code local. By default, SnapGPT automatically opens the snapshotted code file in **Cursor**, so that on the ChatGPT Desktop app your code repository is "autofocused" and you can start asking ChatGPT questions right away‚Äîno copy and pasting required. You can configure it to open in other editors as well (VS Code, Windsurf, Zed, Xcode, or any other editor).

SnapGPT crawls through your directories, gathers all relevant code files (based on your config and preferences), and concatenates them into one text file for easy reading or chat-pasting.

## Features ‚ú®
* Collect code from multiple directories into a single output file
* Select specific files to include instead of scanning directories
* Automatically exclude certain directories (e.g., `__pycache__`, `.git`, `node_modules`)
* **Smart directory scanning safety**:
  * Warns when scanning non-Git directories (helps prevent accidental scanning of non-project folders)
  * Detects and warns about system directories (Windows, macOS, Linux) to prevent accidental system scanning
  * Requires explicit confirmation before scanning sensitive directories
* Configurable file extensions (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.tsx`) so you can include exactly what you want
* **Auto-open the snapshot** in an editor of your choice (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Zed, Xcode, or fallback to your system default)
* **Auto-copy to clipboard** - Automatically copy the snapshot to your clipboard (configurable)
* **First-time setup wizard** - Interactive setup to choose your preferred editor and clipboard settings
* **Cross-platform editor support** - Improved support for editors across Windows, Mac, and Linux
* Lightweight and has minimal dependencies
* **Local only**: SnapGPT does not make any network calls, keeping your code fully private

## Installation üöÄ

### macOS (Recommended)

Using **Homebrew**:
```bash
brew install halfprice06/homebrew-tap-snapgpt/snapgpt
```

Using **pipx** (recommended for Python CLI tools):
```bash
# Install pipx if you haven't already
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Install snapgpt
pipx install snapgpt
```

Other Methods:

Using **pip**:
```bash
pip install --user snapgpt
```

Using a **virtual environment**:
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install snapgpt
```

SnapGPT requires Python 3.7+.
It is tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Quick Start üèÉ‚Äç

When you run SnapGPT for the first time, you'll be greeted with a setup wizard:
```
Welcome to snapgpt! Let's set up your preferences.

Available editors:
1. Cursor
2. Code
3. Windsurf
4. Zed
5. Xcode

Which editor would you like to use as default? (enter number): 
Would you like snapshots to be automatically copied to clipboard? (y/n): 
```

After setup, simply run:
```bash
snapgpt
```

By default, SnapGPT will:
1. Recursively scan the current directory (.)
2. Exclude folders such as `__pycache__`, `.git`, `node_modules`, etc.
3. Include files with extensions like `.py`, `.js`, `.md`, `.json`, and more
4. Save everything to `full_code_snapshot.txt`
5. Open that file in your chosen editor
6. Copy the content to your clipboard (if enabled)

You will see:
1. A directory tree at the top of `full_code_snapshot.txt`
2. Followed by the full text of every included file, separated by headers indicating file paths

This single file is perfect for sharing with ChatGPT or any other AI coding assistant (or just for your own review)!

## Usage üìù

```bash
snapgpt [options]
```

## Common Options üõ†Ô∏è

| Option / Flag | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `-d, --directories` | List of directories to scan (default: .) |
| `-f, --files` | List of specific files to include (overrides directory scanning) |
| `-o, --output` | Output file path (default: full_code_snapshot.txt) |
| `-e, --extensions` | File extensions to include (e.g. -e .py .js .md) |
| `--exclude-dirs` | Directories to exclude from scanning |
| `--no-open` | Do not automatically open the snapshot after creation |
| `--no-copy` | Do not copy the snapshot to clipboard |
| `--editor {cursor,code,windsurf,zed,xcode}` | Editor to open the snapshot in |
| `--set-default-editor` | Set the default editor globally |
| `--set-default-extensions` | Set the default file extensions globally |
| `--set-default-exclude-dirs` | Set the default excluded directories globally |
| `--max-size` | Maximum file size in MB to include (0 for no limit) |
| `--max-depth` | Maximum directory depth to traverse (0 for no limit) |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress progress and non-error messages |

## Example Commands üí°

1. Include specific files only:
```bash
snapgpt -f src/main.py tests/test_main.py README.md
```

2. Scan only the src and lib directories, exclude dist:
```bash
snapgpt -d src lib --exclude-dirs dist
```

3. Set default editor to VS Code, then quit immediately:
```bash
snapgpt --set-default-editor code
```

4. Use a max file size limit of 1 MB (1,000,000 bytes) and a max depth of 5 subdirectories:
```bash
snapgpt --max-size 1 --max-depth 5
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

SnapGPT reads configuration from `~/.config/snapgpt/config.json`, which is created during first-time setup or with defaults if you skip the setup.

Example config:
```json
{
  "default_editor": "cursor",
  "auto_copy_to_clipboard": true,
  "first_time_setup_done": true,
  "file_extensions": [".py", ".js", ".ts", ".md", ".json"],
  "exclude_dirs": ["__pycache__", ".git", "node_modules", "build"]
}
```

You can update these values:
* Through the first-time setup wizard
* Using command-line flags like `--set-default-editor` and `--no-copy`
* By directly editing the config file

## Privacy and Security üîí
* **Local Only**: SnapGPT does not send your code to any external server or service. It simply reads files from your disk and consolidates them into a single text file.
* **Editor Launch**: If you choose to open the snapshot automatically, SnapGPT will launch your local editor. No additional code upload or syncing occurs.
* **Directory Safety Checks**:
  * Warns when scanning directories that are not part of a Git repository to prevent accidental scanning of personal folders
  * Detects and warns about system directories on Windows, macOS, and Linux
  * Requires explicit confirmation before proceeding with potentially sensitive directories
  * Default 'no' response in quiet mode for safety

## Troubleshooting üîß

1. **Git Repository Warning**
When scanning a directory that contains a `.git` folder, SnapGPT will warn you that you might be scanning more files than intended. You can:
- Choose to continue by typing 'y'
- Cancel and use more specific paths with `-d` or `-f`
- Use `--max-depth` to limit the scan depth

2. **Command Not Found**
Make sure you installed SnapGPT in a directory on your PATH. Try:
```bash
pip show snapgpt
```
If it's not in your PATH, you may need to use `python -m snapgpt ...` or add the script's location to your PATH.

3. **Permission Denied**
On some systems, certain directories may be locked down. SnapGPT will skip unreadable directories and display a warning.

4. **No Files Found**
If your project has unusual file extensions, add them with `--extensions .mjs .hbs` or via the default config.

5. **Editor Not Opening**
Confirm your chosen editor (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Zed, or Xcode) is installed and accessible from the command line. Note that Xcode is only available on macOS systems. On Windows, SnapGPT will attempt various fallback methods if cursor is your default editor but not found in your PATH.
