def numberOfYears(nSeasons, stnDetails, nearStationIdx, param_path):
    """Computes the number of years in each seasonal pool.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nSeaons : int
        Number of seasons.
    stnDetails : dict where keys are words and values are float
        The record of stations from index.txt.  This is
        passed back as it may have changed shape to add according to
        genSeqOption3.
    nearStationIdx : array
        A set of indices into station data for the
        seasonal nearest like stations. This array is nominally two
        dimensional with the first dimension being the seasons and the
        second the number of stations returned.  This is because there
        are possible different correlations between stations over
        different seasons.
    param_path : dict where keys are words and values are str
        Dictionary of the necessary paths.\n

    Returns
    ----------
    array
        Number of years in each seasonsal pool.
