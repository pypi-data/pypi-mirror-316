    """Loops through nSims performing sub-daily disaggregation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nSims : float
        Number of simulations to be performed.
    targetDailyRain : array
        Array of daily rainfall series for target station.
    param : dict where keys are words and values are float
        Dictionary of the run parameters.
    nGoodDays : array
        Number of good days per year per day per season.
        A "good day" is one that is not of state bad and has
        a depth greater than the dryWetCutoff. 
    fragments : list
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing a count  
        of the number of good fragments available for sampling.
    fragmentsState : list 
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing the daily wetState sequences
        of the good fragments available for sampling.
    fragmentsDailyDepth : list 
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing the daily depth sequences
        of the good fragments available for sampling.\n

    Returns
    ----------
    list
        List of arrays (one for each simulation) of size (recordsPerDay, nDays).
