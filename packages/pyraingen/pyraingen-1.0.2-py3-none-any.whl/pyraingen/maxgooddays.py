    Parameters
    ----------
    nSeaons : int
        Number of seasons.
    nYearsPool : array
        Number of years in each seasonsal pool.
    dailyWetState : List
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing the daily wetState sequences.
    dailyDepth : List
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing the daily depth sequences.
    param : dict where keys are words and values are float
        Dictionary of the run parameters.\n

        Number of good days per year per day per season.
        A "good day" is one that is not of state bad and has
