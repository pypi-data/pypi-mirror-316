def aggregateRainfall(rainfallSeries, nRecordsToAggregate):
    """This function is designed to aggregate, via a summation, six minute
    recorded rainfalls into longer durations.  The longer durations are
    specified as an integer number of records to aggregate and must divide
    evenly into 240 records, which is the number of six minute records per
    day.  That is mod(nRecordsToAggregate, 6) == 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rainfallSeries : array
        Array of the rain fall time series in six
        minute increments (240 per day), with dimenions (240, nDays,
        nSimulations).
    nRecordsToAggregate : int
        Records to aggregate.\n

    Returns
    ----------
    array
        The aggregated rainfall series.
