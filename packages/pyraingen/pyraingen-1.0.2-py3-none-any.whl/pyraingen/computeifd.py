def computeIFD(rainfallSeries, yearsVector, ifdDurations):
    """This function computes an IFD table from the input rainfall series
    based on a set of standard durations and recurrence intervals.  Please
    Note: this may not be as per a full IFD computation but is designed to
    be used inside the IFD Conditioning code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rainfallSeries : array
        A matrix of the rain fall time series in six
        minute increments (240 per day), with dimenions (240, nDays,
        nSimulations).
    yearsVector : array  
        A vector of length nDays filled with integers of
        the years.  It is used to slice into the rainfallSeries.  For
        example, if the first year is 1942 then the first 365 records are
        1942, followed by 365 records of 1943, etc.\n

    Returns
    ----------
    array
        The resultant IFD table with dimensions (nYears,
        nSimulations, nIFDDurations)
