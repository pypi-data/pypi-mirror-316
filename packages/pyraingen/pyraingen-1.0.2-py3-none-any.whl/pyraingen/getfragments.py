def getFragments(nSeasons, nGoodDays, dailyWetState, dailyDepth, stnDetails, nearStationIdx, param, param_path):
    """Loops over the stations andload and store only the fragments whose
    wetstate != 0 (i.e. some possibly good data).

    Parameters
    ----------
    nSeaons : int
        Number of seasons.
    nGoodDays : array
        Number of good days per year per day per season.
        A "good day" is one that is not of state bad and has
        a depth greater than the dryWetCutoff.
    dailyDepth : list
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing the daily depth sequences. 
    dailyWetState : list
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing the daily wetState sequences.
    stnDetails : dict where keys are words and values are float
        The record of stations from index.txt.  This is
        passed back as it may have changed shape to add according to
        genSeqOption3.
    nearStationIdx : array
        A set of indices into station data for the
        seasonal nearest like stations. This array is nominally two
        dimensional with the first dimension being the seasons and the
        second the number of stations returned.  This is because there
        are possible different correlations between stations over
        different seasons.
    param : dict where keys are words and values are float
        Dictionary of the run parameters. 
    param_path : dict where keys are words and values are str
        Dictionary of the necessary paths.\n  

    Returns
    ----------
    fragments : list
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing a count  
        of the number of good fragments available for sampling.
    fragmentsState : list
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing the daily wetState sequences
        of the good fragments available for sampling.
    fragmentsDailyDepth : list
        A list of arrays (one for each season) containing the daily depth sequences
        of the good fragments available for sampling.
