# This workflow is triggered on push to main branch and on a schedule every day at midnight. It also updates any dependencies and runs tests before publishing to PyPI.
# NOTE: the current workflow requires manual intervention in updating dependencies.
# ...If the dependencies are not changed, then the workflow will continue and publish to PyPI with same dependencies as defined.
