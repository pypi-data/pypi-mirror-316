# Statsy
![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/statsy.svg)

**BEWARE: this package is under development.**

**Until a stable release, please use other packages such as [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) or [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)**

## Description

This package is an implementation of common statistical operations and methods for Python users. Although other modules, libraries, and packages already cover much of the content of this package, the expressions and functions are designed to be more user friendly (i.e., written in a more stats-native way).

This package has not been optimized for speed and efficency.

For more information, visit the main repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/cameronmore/Statsy).

## Development and Contributions

Development of this module is ongoing, and will soon be open to contributions.
