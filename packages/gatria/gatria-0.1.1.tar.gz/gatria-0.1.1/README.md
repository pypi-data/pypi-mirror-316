from Gatria import EmployeeManager

# Initialize the EmployeeManager with default settings
manager = EmployeeManager()

# Create a new employee
employee_data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "position": "Software Engineer",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-0100",
    "date_hired": "2022-01-15"
}

employee = manager.create_employee(employee_data)

# Retrieve employee information
retrieved_employee = manager.get_employee(employee.id)
print(retrieved_employee.to_dict())

# Update employee data
updated_data = {"position": "Senior Software Engineer"}
manager.update_employee(employee.id, updated_data)

# Delete an employee
manager.delete_employee(employee.id)
```

# In your urls.py
from django.urls import path, include
from Gatria.adapters.django import DjangoAdapter

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('employees/', include(DjangoAdapter.get_urls())),
]
```

### Database Operations

#### Using SQLAlchemy

```python
from Gatria.database.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyDatabase
from Gatria import EmployeeManager

db = SQLAlchemyDatabase('sqlite:///employees.db')
manager = EmployeeManager(database=db)

# Perform database operations
```

#### Using MongoDB

```python
from Gatria.database.mongodb import MongoDBDatabase
from Gatria import EmployeeManager

db = MongoDBDatabase('mongodb://localhost:27017/', 'Gatria_db')
manager = EmployeeManager(database=db)

# Perform database operations
```

### Asynchronous Operations

```python
import asyncio
from Gatria import EmployeeManager

async def main():
    manager = EmployeeManager(async_mode=True)
    employee = await manager.create_employee_async({
        "name": "Jane Smith",
