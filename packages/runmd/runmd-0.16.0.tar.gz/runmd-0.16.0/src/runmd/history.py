"""
History Management for the 'runmd' CLI Tool

This module provides functionality for managing command history in the 'runmd' CLI tool. It allows
for reading from, writing to, and updating the command history file, as well as printing and
cleaning command entries.

Functions:
    - get_history_path: Return the path to the command history file.
    - read_history: Read and return the command history from the file.
    - write_history: Write the command history to the file.
    - update_history: Update the history with a new command and manage history size.
    - print_history: Print the stored command history.
    - clean_command: Clean up the command string by removing unnecessary parts before the 'runmd'
      command.

Attributes:
    - None

This module handles the persistent storage of command history, ensuring that the history file is
updated accurately and can be used to track previous commands.
