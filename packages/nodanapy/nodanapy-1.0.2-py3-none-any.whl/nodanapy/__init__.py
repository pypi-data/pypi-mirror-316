## NodAnaPy

This packages designed to determine the Nodal Analysis of the gas or oil well.

### Key Features:

- Calculate hold-up liquid
- Calculate inflow performance relationship
- Calculate vertical lift performance

### Modules:

- ipr: Classes to determine inflow performance relationship
- vlp: Classes to determine vertical lift performance
- _properties: Classes to calculate the properties of oil, gas and water
- wellNA: File .py where it is located to determine nodal analysis

### Usage:

Import the necessary modules and use the provided functions to compute nodal analysis well. For detailed examples and usage, refer to the documentation.
    
### Example:

```python
    from nodanapy import WellNAOilR
    
    pr = 4500 # reservoir pressure
    tr = 140 + 460 # reservoir temperature
    ph = 140 # wellhead pressure
    th = 84 + 460 # wellhead temperature
    pb = 1500 # bubble pressure
    
    well = WellNAOilR(ph, th, pr, tr, pb)

    ipr_well = well.ipr
    vlp_well = well.vlp
    
    print('IPR', ipr_well)
    print('VLP', vlp_well)
```
