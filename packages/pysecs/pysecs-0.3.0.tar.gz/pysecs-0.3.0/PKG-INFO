# pysecs

pysecs is an open source library for calculating Spherical Elementary Current Systems (SECS).

## Features

- Based upon the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) framework with `fit()` and `predict()` methods.
- The only dependency is [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). It is built using fast broadcasting techniques to provide highly scalable calculations.

## Examples

Examples can be found in [examples/](./examples/)

## Install

The easiest method to install pysecs is with pip.

```bash
> pip install pysecs
```

For a source install you can follow these instructions:

1. Clone the git repository

    ```bash
    > git clone https://github.com/greglucas/pysecs
    ```

2. Build and install the package

    ```bash
    > python setup.py install
    ```

3. Testing
The package has a test suite that can be run with pytest

    ```python
    > pytest
    ```
