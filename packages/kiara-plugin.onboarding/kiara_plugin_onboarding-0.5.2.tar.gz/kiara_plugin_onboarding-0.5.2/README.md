## Description

TODO

## Development

### Requirements

- Python (version >= 3.8)
- pip, virtualenv
- git
- make (on Linux / Mac OS X -- optional)


### Prepare development environment

If you only want to work on the modules, and not the core *Kiara* codebase, follow the instructions below. Otherwise, please
check the notes on how to setup a *Kiara* development environment under (TODO).

#### Using `pixi` (recommended)

The recommended way to setup a development environment is to use [pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi). Check out [their install instructions](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi#installation).

Once you have `pixi` installed, you need to initialize the environment once:

```
pixi run install-dev-dependencies
```

You also need to do this whenever a depdendency of this plugin is updated (for example the core `kiara` package).

Once that is done, you can enter the environment with:

```
pixi shell
```

This will start a sub-shell with the virtual environment activated, and all dependencies of the plugin package installed. To confirm it works, you can run any `kiara` command:

```
kiara --version
# or
kiara operation list
# or
...
...
```

Once you are finished with your development session, you can exit the sub-shell as you would normally do in such cases:

```
exit
```

Alternatively, you can also run the `kiara` executable directly, it is located in `.pixi/env/bin/kiara`. So either adapt your `PATH` variable, or do something like:

```
.pixi/env/bin/kiara operation list
```

In most cases it's recommended to use a pixi shell though.


### Using pre-defined development-related tasks

The included `pyproject.toml` file includes some useful tasks that help with development:

- `pixi run pre-commit-check`: runs a set of checks against all files
- `pixi run tests`: runs the unit tests
- `pixi run mypy`: run mypy checks
