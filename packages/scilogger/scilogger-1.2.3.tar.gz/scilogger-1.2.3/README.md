## Summary

**SciLogger** is a **Python Logging** module:
* Specially targeted for **scientific applications**.
* Use a **global timer** to measure the **elapsed time**.
* Provide a class for **timing code blocks**.
* Definition of **custom indentation levels**.
* Definition of **colors** for the logging levels.

**SciLogger** is using a global **INI configuration** file:
* First, the **default configuration** is loaded (`scilogger/scilogger.ini`).
* Afterward, a **custom file** can be loaded with an environment variable (`SCILOGGER`)

SciLogger is written in Python without any external dependencies.
SciLogger is respecting **semantic versioning** (starting from version 1.2).

## Warning

* This logging module is **based** on the **Python logging module**.
* The philosophy of this logging module is slightly different. 
* Mixing both modules can create strange/incorrect behaviors.

## Example

An example is located in the `example` folder of the repository:
* `run_logger.py` contains an example file for the logger
* `configlogger.ini` contains a custom configuration file

```bash
# Set the configuration file.
export SCILOGGER="configlocal.ini"

# Run the Python script.
python run_logger.py
```
