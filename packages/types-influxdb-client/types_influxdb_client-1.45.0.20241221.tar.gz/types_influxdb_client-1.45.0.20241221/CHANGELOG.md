## 1.37.0.1 (2023-10-01)

Remove stubs for `urllib3` (#10812)

Both types-requests and types-influxdb-client now depend on urllib3>=2 instead of types-urllib3. That in turn means that types-caldav, types-slumber and types-requests-oauthlib all depend indirectly on urllib3>=2, since all three stubs packages depend on types-requests.

Stubtest settings: change `ignore_missing_stub` default to `false` (#9779)

If you're reading about this commit from an autogenerated changelog entry, this should have no user-visible impact on how the stubs are interpreted by a type checker; it's just an internal change to how typeshed's tests work.
