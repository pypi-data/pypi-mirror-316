    """
    Fits model to given data with minimization of residuals. 
    
    Args:
        model (callable): Models the data. It must take the independent variable as the first argument and the parameters (as an array) as the second argument.
        data (array): The dependent (measured) data.
        time (array): The independent variable when the data is measured.
        param (array): Parameters of the model
    
    Returns:
        res.x (array): Optimal values for the parameters so that the sum of the squared residuals between measured and modelled data is minimized.
