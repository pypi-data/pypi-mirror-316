proj4: +proj=stere +lon_0=28.9 +lat_0=82.96 +lat_ts=80 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m
# Spatial extent of the domain on which the processing will be performed
extent: -100000 -80000 100000 80000
# Resolution of the reprojected SAR images in meters
sar_resolution: 100
# Minimal SAR signal to include in the processing. Values below are clipped.
min_sar_signal: 0.005
# Percentile limits of the SAR image clipping. Values below or above the <plim> percentile are clipped.

## SuperLIMo parameters
# Torch device

# E.g., if resolution is 100, then with pm_step 20 ice drift vectors will be spaced by 2000 m.
pm_step: 20

pm_pol: hh
# Size of the template in pixels
pm_template_size: 33
# Size of the border around the template in pixels
pm_border: 32
