# sweepystats

*Because sweepy was taken*

`sweepystats` is a python package for performing the statistical [sweep operation](https://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2017spring/slides/11-sweep/sweep.html) on `numpy` matrices. The class `SweepMatrix` is a thin wrapper over numpy `darray`s that can be swept forward or backwards. 

:warning: **This is my hobby project during Christmas 2024. Use at your own risk!** :warning:

## Features

The following operations are supported **in-place** and **allocation-free**:

+ Matrix inversions
+ Computation of determinants
+ Checking of (strict) positive-definiteness
+ Linear regression (beta hat, variance of OLS estimator, residuals)

## Running tests

1. Git clone the repo
2. Install `pytest` via `pip3 install pytest` if you haven't already
3. Execute `pytest tests` in the top level directory of `sweepy`
