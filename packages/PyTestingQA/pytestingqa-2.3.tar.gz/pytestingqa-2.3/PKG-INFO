# PyTesting
A Python library that contains tools for unit testing.

# How to use
To use the project, you have two options:

### Program execution.
If you execute the program as a main module, it will
print a small description of the project. 

### Tool use.
Instead, if you import the module to your project or 
you build your own code on the library's file, you will
be able to use it directly.

# Remember to read the code's comments, they contain very useful information.
