## Installation from PyPI

## Usage as standalone program

Simply run

At the first call it will open a browser with a temporary profile to get the
session cookies from the login. You need to login with your credentials. The next
step of accepting the advertisement and tracking is not necessary. After closing
the browser the program will continue with the download of the specified issues.
At subsequent calls the stored cookies will be used. If needed the cookies can be
recreated with `--recreate-cookie-jar` at any time.

Access the help of the program with

```sh
getzeit -h
```

to obtain information about the optional arguments and the issue selection
procedure.
