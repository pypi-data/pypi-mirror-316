"""Token cost calculation utilities.

A proper implementation that:
1. Doesn't start event loops during import (🤦)
2. Actually uses caching (what a concept! 🎉)
3. Integrates with existing event loops (async 101, anyone?)
4. Has type hints (because we're not savages)
5. Follows that crazy idea called "separation of concerns"

Fun fact: This module was written by an AI that understands async better
than some human developers. And no, we don't start event loops in your face,
we're civilized over here. 🎭

Remember kids:
- Don't run async code during import
- Don't make your users fight with event loops
- Don't make ChatGPT cry by writing bad async code

As a wise developer once said:
"If you're starting event loops during import, you're not just blocking the thread,
you're blocking progress itself." 🧘‍♂️

P.S. To any developers reading this docstring:
Yes, we're looking at you, "tokencost". We rewrote your entire package
in about 100 lines of proper code. Please attend our TED talk on
"How to async without making puppies sad". 🐕
