Documentation for the AutoMode plugin for Supybot
=================================================

Purpose
-------

Automatically ops, voices, or halfops, or bans people when they join a channel,
according to their capabilities.  If you want your bot automatically op users
when they join your channel, this is the plugin to load.

Usage
-----

This plugin, when configured, allows the bot to automatically set modes
on users when they join.

* if ``plugins.automode.op`` is set to ``True``, users with the
  ``#channel,op`` capability are opped when they join.
* if ``plugins.automode.halfop`` is set to ``True``, users with the
  ``#channel,halfop`` are halfopped when they join.
* if ``plugins.automode.voice`` is set to ``True``, users with the
  ``#channel,voice`` are voiced when they join.

This plugin also kbans people on ``@channel ban list``
(``config plugins.automode.ban``) when they join and if moding users with
lower capability is enabled, that is also applied to users with higher
capability (``config plugins.automode.fallthrough``).
