Usage
=====

PyCAT-Napari offers multiple ways to analyze your data, with an emphasis on providing a low/no-code solution through its graphical user interface (GUI). While programmatic API access is available, the GUI is the recommended interface for most users.

Usage Options
-------------

1. **GUI Application (Recommended)**
   
   The graphical interface provides an intuitive environment for image analysis, built on the napari viewer. This is the recommended approach for most users, especially those new to image analysis or those who prefer a visual workflow.

2. **Programmatic API**
   
   For automated analysis or integration into existing workflows, PyCAT's core functions can be accessed programmatically. However, note that the API is primarily designed to support the GUI and hasn't been extensively tested for standalone use.
