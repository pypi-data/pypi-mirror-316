# BDK Klang

This project is a Python-based natural language parser designed to analyze structured English text signatures. It 
leverages the KlangParser class to interpret commands or sentences, extracting key components such as verbs, 
objects, prepositions, targets, outputs, and proper nouns. The parser is particularly suited for natural language 
processing tasks that involve breaking down text into actionable and analyzable elements.
