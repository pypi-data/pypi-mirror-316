# uv-secure

Scan your uv.lock file for dependencies with known vulnerabilities

## Installation

I recommend installing uv-secure as a uv tool or with pipx as it's intended to be used
as a CLI tool and it probably only makes sense to have one version installed globally.

Installing with uv tool as follows:

```shell
uv tool install uv-secure
```

or with pipx:

```shell
pipx install uv-secure
```

you can optionally install uv-secure as a development dependency in a virtual
environment.

## Usage

After installation you can run uv-secure --help to see the options.

```text
>> uv-secure --help

 Usage: uv-secure [OPTIONS]

 Parse a uv.lock file, check vulnerabilities, and display summary.

╭─ Options ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ --uv-lock-path        -p      PATH  Path to the uv.lock file [default: uv.lock]      │
│ --ignore              -i      TEXT  Comma-separated list of vulnerability IDs to     │
│                                     ignore, e.g. VULN-123,VULN-456                   │
│ --version                           Show the application's version                   │
│ --install-completion                Install completion for the current shell.        │
│ --show-completion                   Show completion for the current shell, to copy   │
│                                     it or customize the installation.                │
│ --help                              Show this message and exit.                      │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

By default if run with no options uv-secure will look for a uv.lock file in the current
working directory and scan that for known vulnerabilities. E.g.

```text
>> uv-secure
Checking dependencies for vulnerabilities...
╭───────────────────────────────╮
│ No vulnerabilities detected!  │
│ Checked: 160 dependencies     │
│ All dependencies appear safe! │
╰───────────────────────────────╯
```

## Related Work and Motivation

I created this package as I wanted a dependency vulnerability scanner but I wasn't
completely happy with the options that seemed available. I use
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and wanted something that works with uv.lock files but
neither of the main package options I found fitted my requirements:

- [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) only works with requirements.txt
  files but even if you convert a uv.lock file to a requirements.txt file, pip-audit
  wants to create a whole virtual environment to check all transitive dependencies (but
  that should be completely unnecessary when the lock file already contains the full
  dependencies).
- [safety](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) also doesn't work with uv.lock file out of
  the box, it does apparently work statically without needing to build a virtual
  environment but it does require you to create an account on the
  [safety site](https://platform.safetycli.com/). They have some limited free account
  but require a paid account to use seriously. If you already have a safety account
  though there is a [uv-audit](https://pypi.org/project/uv-audit/) package that wraps
  safety to support scanning uv.lock files.
- [Python Security PyCharm Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13609-python-security)
  Lastly I was inspired by Anthony Shaw's Python Security plugin - which does CVE
  dependency scanning within PyCharm.

I build uv-secure because I wanted a CLI tool I could run with pre-commit. Statically
analyse the uv.lock file without needing to create a virtual environment, and finally
doesn't require you to create (and pay for) an account with any service.
