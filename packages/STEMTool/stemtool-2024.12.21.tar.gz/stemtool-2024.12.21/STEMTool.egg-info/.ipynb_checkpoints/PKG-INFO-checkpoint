[**STEMTool is now a part of the Pycroscopy ecosystem**](https://github.com/pycroscopy/stemtool). Issues will be only tracked from that repo. 

Python based codes for analysis of 4D-STEM and aberration corrected vanilla STEM datasets. 

I recently gave a small talk on STEMTool at the 2020 M&M virtual conference. Watch the talk here to get an idea of STEMTool's capabilities:
