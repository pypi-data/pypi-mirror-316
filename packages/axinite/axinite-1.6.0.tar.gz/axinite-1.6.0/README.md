## Overview
**Axinite** is an engine for calculating celestial motion. 
You can use it to design your own solar systems, predict trajectories of rockets, simulate gravitational interactions and more.

Check out the docs [here](https://jewels86.gitbook.io/axinite/axinite/getting-started).
### What is `axtools`?
`axtools` is a library to help abstract and simplify Axinite. With `axtools`, Developers can deploy Axinite powered applications with ease. 
You can find the docs [here](https://jewels86.gitbook.io/axinite/axtools/quickstart).

### Executable
Axinite will soon be coming to executable format! 

Development is still in progress.
