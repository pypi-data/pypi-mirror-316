Here are a couple options for those who simply want to use the project.

### As an installed Package:

TBD - for directly downloading the package folder

### Using Pip Install:

0. Have Python installed and the latest version of Pip
1. Use `pip install the-link-reaper`
2. See [here](#Terminal) for what you can do with this package.

## For Developers

### Instructions
0. Have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
1. Fork this repo (if you want to contribute. If not, skip this step)
2. Find/create your directory of choice
3. Open a terminal in that directory and use `git clone https://github.com/<your name>/<your fork name here>.git` but if you are not using a fork, just use `https://github.com/sharktrexer/link-reaper.git`
4. Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv`

### Contributing

Feel free to create Issues or Pull Requests at your leisure. If you are unsure if the PR is a good idea, create an Issue first and I will respond as best as I can.

Before creating a pull request, be sure to use the following commands after implementing your changes (and make sure you installed dependencies from dev_requirements.txt):
```
# Lint code
ruff check link-reaper

# Apply lint fixes (you may have to do some manually)
ruff check --fix

# Format changes
ruff format link-reaper

# Optional for bonus points
pylint link-reaper
```
If you don't use the ruff commands, the workflow of this project will fail and it will take longer to merge your potentially beautiful changes!
