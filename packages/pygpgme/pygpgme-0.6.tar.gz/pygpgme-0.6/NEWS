pygpgme-0.6: 2024-12-22

 * Fix missing NULL terminator on SigNotation getsets list, which
   could cause a crash when importing the package.

pygpgme-0.5: 2024-11-23

 * Require libgpgme >= 1.13.0.
 * Fix Python 3.9 compatibility. If using Python 3.9,
   typing_extensions is a dependency.
 * Add support for creating signature notations (Till Maas).
 * Add the Context.get_engine_info() method (Tobias Mueller).
 * Add Context.delete(), Context.export_keys() and
   Context.import_keys() methods.
 * Integrate the Sphinx docs from the github.com/rshk/gpgme repo
   (Samuele Santi, Torf, H. Park).
 * Move the API docs into method docstrings.

pygpgme-0.4: 2024-08-07

 * Modernise build system of the project and drop Python 2 support. We
   now require Python >= 3.10 to build.
 * Add documentation comments (Tim Allen)
 * Add support for pinentry mode (Werner Koch)
 * Extend gpgme.Context.export() to take an export_mode parameter
   (Daniele Ricci)
 * Add pubkey_algo and hash_algo attributes to Signature objects (Till Maas)
 * Convert enumeration and flag constants to use enum module
   types. All constants from 0.3 remain available under their old
   names for compatibility.
 * The module provides type information, including a stub for the C
   extension. This enables mypy type checking for users of the package.
 * The test suite has been updated to pass with modern GPG.

pygpgme-0.3: 2012-03-08

 * Add support for Python 3 (tested with Python 3.2).  Data being
   encrypted, decrypted, signed or verified is treated as bytes, while
   textual data (including textual representations of binary data like
   key IDs) uses the string/unicode type.
 * The test suite has been moved to the toplevel and is no longer
   installed with the extension.
 * The examples directory is now included in tarball releases.

pygpgme-0.2: 2011-08-17

 * Update the code base to work with newer versions of GPGME
 * Update extension code to make it easier to port to Python 3 (this
   version still doesn't support Python 3). In general, this involves
   making sure we return Unicode strings for textual data and byte
   strings for binary data.
 * Add support for the genkey API.
 * Add support for symmetric encryption in encrypt().

pygpgme-0.1: 2006-03-27

 * Initial Release.
