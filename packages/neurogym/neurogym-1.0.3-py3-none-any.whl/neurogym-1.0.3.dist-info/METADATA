        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
        1.  Definitions.
        
            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.
        
            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.
        
            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
        2.  Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
        3.  Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4.  Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:
        
            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and
        
            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and
        
            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.
        
            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

NeuroGym inherits from the machine learning toolkit [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), a maintained fork of [OpenAI’s Gym library](https://github.com/openai/gym). It allows a wide range of well established machine learning algorithms to be easily trained on behavioral paradigms relevant for the neuroscience community.
NeuroGym also incorporates several properties and functions (e.g. continuous-time and trial-based tasks) that are important for neuroscience applications. The toolkit also includes various modifier functions that allow easy configuration of new tasks.

### Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment to install the current package, e.g. using
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) (please refer to their
site for questions about creating the environment):

```bash
conda activate # ensures you are in the base environment
conda create -n neurogym python=3.11
conda activate neurogym
```

Then install neurogym as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neurogym/neurogym.git
cd neurogym
pip install -e .
```

#### Psychopy installation

If you need psychopy for your project, additionally run

```bash
pip install psychopy
```

### Tasks

Currently implemented tasks can be found [here](https://neurogym.github.io/envs/index.html).

### Wrappers

Wrappers (see [list](https://github.com/gyyang/neurogym/blob/master/docs/wrappers.md))
are short scripts that allow introducing modifications the original tasks. For instance, the Random Dots Motion task can be transformed into a reaction time task by passing it through the _reaction_time_ wrapper. Alternatively, the _combine_ wrapper allows training an agent in two different tasks simultaneously.

### Examples

NeuroGym is compatible with most packages that use gymnasium.
In this [example](https://github.com/gyyang/neurogym/blob/master/examples/example_neurogym_rl.ipynb) jupyter notebook we show how to train a neural network with reinforcement learning algorithms using the [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) toolbox.

### Custom tasks

Creating custom new tasks should be easy. You can contribute tasks using the regular gymnasium format. If your task has a trial/period structure, this [template](https://github.com/gyyang/neurogym/blob/master/examples/template.py) provides the basic structure that we recommend a task to have:

```python
from gymnasium import spaces
import neurogym as ngym

class YourTask(ngym.PeriodEnv):
    metadata = {}

    def __init__(self, dt=100, timing=None, extra_input_param=None):
        super().__init__(dt=dt)


    def new_trial(self, **kwargs):
        """
        new_trial() is called when a trial ends to generate the next trial.
        Here you have to set:
        The trial periods: fixation, stimulus...
        Optionally, you can set:
        The ground truth: the correct answer for the created trial.
        """

    def _step(self, action):
        """
        _step receives an action and returns:
            a new observation, obs
            reward associated with the action, reward
            a boolean variable indicating whether the experiment has terminated, terminated
                See more at https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/gymnasium_basics/handling_time_limits/#termination
            a boolean variable indicating whether the experiment has been truncated, truncated
                See more at https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/gymnasium_basics/handling_time_limits/#truncation
            a dictionary with extra information:
                ground truth correct response, info['gt']
                boolean indicating the end of the trial, info['new_trial']
        """

        return obs, reward, terminated, truncated, {'new_trial': new_trial, 'gt': gt}

```
