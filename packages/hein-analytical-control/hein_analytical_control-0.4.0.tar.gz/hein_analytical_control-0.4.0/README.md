# Hein Analytical Control
[![PyPI Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/hein-analytical-control.svg?label=PyPI%20downloads)](https://pypi.org/project/hein-analytical-control)

A Python package to interact with the ChemStation software. Other equipment mentioned in the original library can be used, but have not been tested in the Hein lab.

## Usage
Before running this library, these are the steps you need to complete.

### Adding required MACRO script

1. Open ChemStation
2. Run this in the ChemStation command line: ``Print _AutoPath$``. Go to this path in your file navigator, as this is where you will put your
MACRO file(s). 
3. Download the [`hplc_talk.mac`](https://github.com/croningp/analyticallabware/blob/master/AnalyticalLabware/devices/Agilent/hplctalk.mac).
   - On line 69, change the path name up to `\cmd` and `\reply`. For instance, you should have: `MonitorFile "[my path]\cmd", "[my path]\reply"`
   - and then add this file to the folder from the previous step. 
4. To have these MACRO files be read by ChemStation, you must either:
   - Open ChemStation and run:
```MACRO
macro hplc_talk.mac
HPLCTalk_Run
```
   - OR add the above lines to a MACRO file named: `user.mac`, and then put `user.mac` in the same folder from step 3. 
     - ChemStation will automatically load these MACRO files for you. However, sometimes this does not work, and if it does not, you will have to run the lines in the `user.mac` manually.

### Adding your own MACROs

If you wish to add your own MACRO functions, then all you need to do is write you MACRO (using Agilent's) MACRO guide, 
put the file in the `user.mac` file and then list the function you want to use.
