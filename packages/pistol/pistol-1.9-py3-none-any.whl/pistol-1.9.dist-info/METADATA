# pistol terminal guide

## installation
all of these installation methods apply to the newest version of pistol unless stated otherwise.

### 1. windows install using `pip` (most recommended for windows machines):
#### step 1: make sure `pip` is updated
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
#### step 2: install pistol
```
pip install pistol
```
### 2. linux/ubuntu install using `pip` and `venv` (most recommended for linux machines):
#### step 1: create a virtual environment using `venv`
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
#### step 2: activate the environment
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
#### step 3: make sure `pip` is updated
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
#### step 4: install pistol
```
python3 -m pip install pistol
```
#### /!\ disclaimer: installing pistol using the second and fourth method will make pistol only accessible while in the venv environment where it has been installed. you may need to redo step 2 every time you restart your terminal.
### 3. windows fetch using `git` and install using `pip`:
#### step 1: clone the pistol repository
```
git clone https://github.com/pixilll/pistol
```
#### step 2: make sure `pip` is updated
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
#### step 3: install the pistol directory
```
pip install ./pistol
```
### 4. linux/ubuntu fetch using `git` and install using `pip` and `venv`:
#### step 1: create a virtual environment using `venv`
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
#### step 2: activate the environment
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
#### step 3: clone the pistol repository
```
git clone https://github.com/pixilll/pistol
```
#### step 4: make sure `pip` is updated
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
#### step 5: install the pistol directory
```
python3 -m pip install ./pistol
```
#### /!\ disclaimer: installing pistol on linux using the second and fourth methods will make pistol only accessible while in the venv environment where it has been installed. you may need to redo step 2 every time you restart your terminal.
### 4. build from source:
#### pistol is open-source on github, and any source code files can be downloaded individually if needed. pistol can be built on your system relatively easily whether you're on windows or linux.

## dependencies

- all dependencies should come preinstalled with pistol
- if a dependency is not installed, run `bucket dep install`
- if `bucket` is not installed, run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`, then `pip install bkt` (on windows)
- if the issue persists, reinstall pistol by running `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`, then `pip install pistol --force`

## how to start pistol
### arguments
- all pistol start methods take one argument: `<location>`
- `<location>` means where pistol will start.
- if `<location>` is not specified, it will be defaulted to `.`
- location can be for ex. `.`, `..`, `/home`, `/`, `~`, `C:/`
- location can also be `storage`, which will enter storage mode instantly.
- if you want to enter a directory named `storage` in `.`, specify `./storage` instead.
### method 1: windows, ubuntu/linux executable (recommended)
- use `pistol <location>`
- tested to work on both windows and linux if everything is set up correctly on the user's device.
- recommended for most use cases
- - quick to type
- - easy to remember
### method 2: windows run as python module
- use `python -m pistol <location>` or `py -m pistol <location>` or similar
- make sure `python` or `py` are linked to python 3.12 or higher using `python --version` or `py --version`
- if the output shows that the python version is lower than python 3.12, try installing the newest version [here](https://python.org)
- once installed, or if you are sure you have python 3.12 or higher installed already, try running `python<version> -m pistol <location>`
- `<version>` means the version of python you have installed.
- - examples: `python3.12`, `python3.13`, `python3.14`
- recommended for internal uses or debugging purposes
- - if the executable (method 1) does not work, this method should almost always work.
- - if it doesn't, try reinstalling or upgrading `pistol` using `pip install --force pistol` (to reinstall) or `pip install --upgrade pistol` (to upgrade)
- - if you are starting `pistol` from within a program, this method is recommended as it is more likely to work on other computers (assuming `pistol` is installed on that computer)
### method 3: ubuntu/linux run as python module
- basically the same at the method 2 (read above)
- run with `python3` instead of `python` or `py`
### method 4: windows, ubuntu/linux run from git clone
- applies only if you have run `git clone https://github.com/pixilll/pistol` or `gh repo clone pixilll/pistol` and are in the same cwd as where you have ran that command
- same as method 2 (on windows) or method 3 (on ubuntu/linux) but you run `<executable> -m pistol.pistol <location>` instead.
