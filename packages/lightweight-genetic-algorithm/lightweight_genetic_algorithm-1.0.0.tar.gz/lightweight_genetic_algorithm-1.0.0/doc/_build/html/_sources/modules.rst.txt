lightweight_genetic_algorithm
-----------------------------

This is the main package that contains all the necessary modules to perform genetic algorithms. Below is an overview of each module:

- **algorithm**: Core functions and classes handling the execution of the genetic algorithm.
- **crossover**: Implementation of crossover functions, enabling genetic material exchange between parent solutions.
- **mutation**: Contains various mutation strategies to introduce diversity in the solutions.
- **population**: Deals with the creation and management of population pools.
- **selection**: Provides methods for selecting the best candidates for reproduction.
