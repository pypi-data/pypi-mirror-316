OmegaViT (Î©ViT) is a cutting-edge vision transformer architecture that combines multi-query attention, rotary embeddings, state space modeling, and mixture of experts to achieve superior performance across various computer vision tasks. The model can process images of any resolution while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Resolution Processing**: Handles arbitrary input image sizes through adaptive patch embedding
- **Multi-Query Attention (MQA)**: Reduces computational complexity while maintaining model expressiveness
- **Rotary Embeddings**: Enables better modeling of relative positions and spatial relationships
- **State Space Models (SSM)**: Integrates efficient sequence modeling every third layer
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Implements conditional computation for enhanced model capacity
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in loguru integration for detailed execution tracking
- **Shape-Aware Design**: Continuous tensor shape tracking for reliable processing
