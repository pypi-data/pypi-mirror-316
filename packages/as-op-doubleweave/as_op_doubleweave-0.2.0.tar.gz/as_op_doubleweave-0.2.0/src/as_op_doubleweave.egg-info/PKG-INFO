# Convert weaving pattern files to overshot-patterned double weave

The patterns must obey these restrictions (after optional filtering, and ignoring ends with no shaft and picks with no treadle):

* Each warp thread must be threaded on only one shaft.
* The pattern must contain treadling information (not pure liftplan).
* The pattern must use no more than one treadle per weft thread.
* The pattern must have the same number of treadles as shafts.

## Installing the Software

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.11 or later.

* Install this "as_op_doubleweave" package on the computer with command: **pip install as_op_doubleweave**

## Usage

On the command line run:

  **as_op_doubleweave** ***pattern_files***

The pattern files may be .wif or .dtx files. The converted files are always .wif.

Filtering options:

  * **--skip-even-ends**  for shadow weave patterns, for example
  * **--skip-odd-ends**  (same)
  * **--skip-even-picks**  for shadow weave patterns, patterns with tabby added, etc.
  * **--skip-odd-picks**  (same)
  * **--skip-treadles** for patterns with dedicated treadles for tabby or other tie-down picks

The converted files are written to the same directory as the input files, and the file names include the filtering options used. This allows you to easily compare the result of converting a file with different filtering options.

The converted files include a bit of program-specific information for [WeaveIt](https://weaveit.com), setting the weave type to double weave so the detailed fabric view looks correct. Other programs will ignore this information.

Here is an example using handweaving.net shadow weave pattern [79721](https://www.handweaving.net/draft-detail/79721/stars-and-diamonds-reena-meijer-drees-2004-2022). First download the wif file (not as a liftplan), then convert it as follows:

  **as_op_doubleweave 79721.wif --skip-even-ends --skip-even-picks**

This writes file "79721 as op doubleweave skip-even-ends skip-even-picks.wif".

You can also include all ends and picks from the original pattern. This gives a very different result that is also nice:

  **as_op_doubleweave 79721.wif**

## Developer Tips

* Download the source code from [github](https://github.com/r-owen/as_op_doubleweave.git),
  or make a fork and download that.

* Inside the directory, issue the following commands:

    * **pip install -e .** (note the final period) to install an "editable" version of the package.
      Meaning a version that runs from the source code, so any changes you make can be run without reinstalling.

    * **pre-commit install** to activate the pre-commit hooks.
