    FreeClimb API

    FreeClimb is a cloud-based application programming interface (API) that puts the power of the Vail platform in your hands. FreeClimb simplifies the process of creating applications that can use a full range of telephony features without requiring specialized or on-site telephony equipment. Using the FreeClimb REST API to write applications is easy! You have the option to use the language of your choice or hit the API directly. Your application can execute a command by issuing a RESTful request to the FreeClimb API. The base URL to send HTTP requests to the FreeClimb REST API is: /apiserver. FreeClimb authenticates and processes your request.  # noqa: E501

If set to false, FreeClimb will append the user inputs to the end of the existing digits buffer and will return digits from the start of the digits buffer.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            initial_timeout_ms (int): Maximum time in milliseconds that FreeClimb will wait for the Caller to press the first digit before making a determination that a `timeout` has occurred and moving on to make the request to the `actionUrl` to submit the results of the `GetDigits` command. This timeout interval begins when all nested commands have been fully executed.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
