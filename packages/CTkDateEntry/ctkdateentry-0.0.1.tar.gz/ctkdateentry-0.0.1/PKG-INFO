# CTkDateEntry

**CTkDateEntry** is a Python library that extends the use of `customtkinter` to provide custom widgets such as a customtkinter DateEntry with a calendar (`CTkCalendar`) with selectable dates. It was designed to make it easier to create more modern and interactive graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

## Features

- **CTkDateEntry**: A custom DateEntry based on Customtkinter to facilitate date selection in graphical interfaces.

## Themes

- **CTkDateEntry**: When customtkinter themes are applied to the graphical interface, they are automatically applied to CTkDateEntry, meaning there is no need to use a separate Theme Style
