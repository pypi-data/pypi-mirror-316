    Returns a circuit in which the given iterators have been merged and idle

    Parameters
    ----------
    ops
        List of operations to merge represented as a tuple of the operation
        function iterator and the layout(s) to be applied to.
        The functions need to have ``(model, *layouts)`` as signature.
        There must be an entry for each layout except if it is participating
        in a two-qubit gate, then there must be one entry per pair.
        Each layout can only appear once, i.e. it can only perform one
        operation. Operations do not include QEC cycles (see
        ``merge_qec_cycles`` to merge cycles).
        The TICK instructions must appear together.
    model
        Noise model for the gates.
    detectors
        Detector definitions to use.
    log_obs_inds
        List of dictionaries to be used when defining the logical observable
        arguments. The key specifies the logical qubit label and the value
        specifies the index to be used for the stim arguments.
        It can also be an integer. Then the arguments for the OBSERVABLE_INCLUDE
        will be the given integer and increments of it by 1 so that all
        observables are different.
    anc_reset
        If ``True``, ancillas are reset at the beginning of the QEC cycle.
        By default ``True``.
    anc_detectors
        List of ancilla qubits for which to define the detectors.
        If ``None``, adds all detectors.
        By default ``None``.

    more than one logical qubit, one cannot measure some qubits in the logical X
    basis and some others in the logical Z basis. Therefore, the ``rot_bases``
