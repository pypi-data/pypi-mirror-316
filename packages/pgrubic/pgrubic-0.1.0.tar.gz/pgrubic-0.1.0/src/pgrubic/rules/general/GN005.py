    Checks for indexes with more than three elements.

    ## **Why not?**
    From the documentation:
    > Multicolumn indexes should be used sparingly. In most situations, an index on a
    > single column is sufficient and saves space and time.
    > Indexes with more than three columns are unlikely to be helpful unless the usage of
    > the table is extremely stylized.

    ## **When should you?**
    If you really need to.

    See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-bitmap-scans.html for some
    discussion of the merits of different index configurations.

    ## **Use instead:**
    Keep your index elements at most three.
