# DBT examples

A collection of examples demonstrating the different capabilities of the DBT extension

## Setup

The examples require valid DBT projects to be present in order for the flows to run. Each example contains a `setup.sh` script for bootstrapping the example.

See the example specific README.md for more details on each of them.

Note: DBT version 1.7.0 is the minimum required version to support generating documentation as part of the flow with `generate_docs=True`
