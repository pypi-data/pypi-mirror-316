The CommonRoad-CARLA Interface provides APIs to use CommonRoad-based tools together with the 3D simulator [CARLA](https://carla.org).


## Installation
### Carla
Install Carla 9.15 via as described in the
[CARLA documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/#b-package-installation)
(either use the system installation or download a release from their GitHub repository).
Also add the additional maps if you want to use them.
You can test the successful download/usage of CARLA via running ./CarlaEU4.sh within the CARLA installation.

### CommonRoad-CARLA Interface

#### Usage in other projects
We provide an PyPI package which can be installed with the following command
```shell
pip install commonroad-carla-interface
```

#### License
The CommonRoad-CARLA-Interface is published under GNU3 license (since this is the most restrictive license
of a Python package we import).
We base some parts of our code on CARLA's
example scripts ([MIT license](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/dev/LICENSE)): https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/dev/PythonAPI/examples, e.g. the head-up display.

#### Development
It is recommended to use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as an environment manager.
Clone the repository and install it with poetry.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:commonroad/commonroad-carla-interface.git
poetry shell
poetry install
```
We recommend to use PyCharm (Professional) as IDE.


## Getting started
We provide [tutorial script](https://github.com/commonroad/commonroad-carla-interface/tutorials/)
for different features we support.
A deployed version of the documentation can be found
[here](https://cps.pages.gitlab.lrz.de/commonroad/commonroad-carla-interface/).
You can use these tutorial scripts as the starting point.
The code for converting a map from CommonRoad to OpenDRIVE is located in
the [CommonRoad Scenario Designer](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/tools/scenario-designer).

### Supported Features
We support five ways of interacting with CARLA:

- **CommonRoad scenario replay**: 2D/3D visualization of CommonRoad scenarios together with solutions.
- **Keyboard control**: Controlling an ego vehicle via keyboard in a 2D/3D visualization.
- **Scenario Generation**: Generation of CommonRoad scenarios with different configurations.
- **Motion planning**: Driving in a CARLA simulation with a CommonRoad-based motion planner.
- **Wheel control**: Controlling an ego vehicle via steering wheel and pedals in a 2D/3D visualization.


The default configuration can be found under `crcarla.helper.config` and in our documentation.
The CARLA interface can take care of starting the CARLA server.
The path to CARLA can either be provided manually via the config parameters or the CARLA release folder path corresponds
to one of our default locations: /opt/carla-simulator/, /~/CARLA_0.9.14_RSS/, /~/CARLA_0.9.15/ (default paths work only
for Ubuntu; for a complete list of default paths, see our configuration options).


## Documentation
A deployed version of the documentation can be found
[here](https://cps.pages.gitlab.lrz.de/commonroad/commonroad-carla-interface/).
You can also generate the documentation within your activated Poetry environment using.
```bash
poetry shell
mkdocs build
```
The documentation will be located under site, where you can open `index.html` in your browser to view it.
For updating the documentation you can also use the live preview:
```bash
poetry shell
mkdocs serve
```

	            end-to-end learning, lacking specific interfaces for motion planning. We present an interface for the
	            CARLA simulator focusing on motion planning, e.g., to create configurable test scenarios and execute
	            motion planners in interactive environments. Additionally, we introduce a converter from lanelet-based maps
	            to OpenDRIVE, making it possible to use CommonRoad and Lanelet2 maps in CARLA. Our evaluation shows that
	            our interface is easy to use, creates new scenarios efficiently, and can successfully integrate motion
	            planners to solve CommonRoad scenarios. Our tool is published as an open-source toolbox at commonroad.in.tum.de.},

                    In this paper, we address this problem using our open-source toolbox that provides map converters
                    from different formats to the well-known CommonRoad format. Our toolbox provides converters for
                    OpenStreetMap, Lanelet/Lanelet2, OpenDRIVE, and SUMO. Additionally, a graphical user interface is
                    included, which allows one to efficiently create and manipulate CommonRoad maps and scenarios.
                    We demonstrate the functionality of the toolbox by creating CommonRoad maps and scenarios based on
                    other map formats and manually-created map data.},

               CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training,
               and validation of autonomous urban driving systems. In addition to open-source
               code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings,
               vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely.
               The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and
               environmental conditions. We use CARLA to study the performance of three
               approaches to autonomous driving: a classic modular pipeline, an end-to-end model
               trained via imitation learning, and an end-to-end model trained via reinforcement learning.
               The approaches are evaluated in controlled scenarios of increasing difficulty,
               and their performance is examined via metrics provided by CARLA, illustrating the platform’s utility for autonomous driving research.},
