## Introduction

TerminalAlert is a command-line application that keeps you informed about the
completion of your terminal commands.

Once a command completes, TerminalAlert sends a desktop notification indicating whether it succeeded or failed.

Perfect for multitaskers, this tool helps you stay productive without
having to monitor the terminal constantly.

### Features

- **Command Completion Alerts**: Receive desktop notifications when your terminal commands finish executing.
- **Detailed Command Summary**: After execution, the terminal displays:
    - `Output`: Standard output (if any).
    - `Error`: Standard error (if any).
    - `Execution time`: The time taken in seconds.
- **Success & Failure Indicators**: Notifications clearly indicate whether the command succeeded or encountered errors.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Some applications may output error messages to `stderr` even when they execute successfully. For example:
>
> ```bash
> terminalalert "git clone https://github.com/Jemeni11/TerminalAlert.git TADupl"
> ```
> May produce the following:
> ```
> Output: None  
> Error: Cloning into 'TADupl'...  
> Execution time: 4.45 seconds  
> ```
> This behavior depends on how the specific application writes to `stdout` and `stderr`.


> [!WARNING]
>
> This tool is only partially complete on Windows. When it sends notifications,
> it may not display the icon next to the title. If you mute TerminalAlert notifications
> on Windows, you will be unable to enable them again. This is a known Windows bug with a fix in progress.

issues).

## Why did I build this?

I was cloning a big git repo while coding. I didn't want to monitor it 24/7, so I minimized the terminal and continued
coding. To my surprise, when I checked after 10 minutes, the process had failed. My network connection was unreliable
that day (let's not name the ISP). I retried multiple times, and it failed multiple times. This experience inspired me
to create a tool that could notify me when a terminal command completes.
