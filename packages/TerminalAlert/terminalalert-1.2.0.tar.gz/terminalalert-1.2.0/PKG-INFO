Introduction
============
TerminalAlert is a command-line application that keeps you informed about the
completion of your terminal commands.

Once a command completes, TerminalAlert sends a desktop notification indicating whether it succeeded or failed.

Perfect for multitaskers, this tool helps you stay productive without
having to monitor the terminal constantly.

Features
--------
* **Command Completion Alerts**: Receive desktop notifications when your terminal commands finish executing.
* **Detailed Command Summary**: After execution, the terminal displays:
    * ``Output``: Standard output (if any).
    * ``Error``: Standard error (if any).
    * ``Execution time``: The time taken in seconds.
* **Success & Failure Indicators**: Notifications clearly indicate whether the command succeeded or encountered errors.
* **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

.. note::
   Some applications may output error messages to ``stderr`` even when they execute successfully. For example:

   ``terminalalert "git clone https://github.com/Jemeni11/TerminalAlert.git TADupl"``

   May produce the following:

      Output: None

      Error: Cloning into 'TADupl'...

      Execution time: 4.45 seconds

   This behavior depends on how the specific application writes to ``stdout`` and ``stderr``.

.. warning::
   This tool is only partially complete on Windows. When it sends notifications,
   it will **NOT** display TerminalAlert as the notification title. The title will likely display 'Python' or a similar
   default. The same goes for the icon next to the title. If you mute TerminalAlert notifications
   on Windows, you will be unable to enable them again. This is a known Windows bug with a fix in progress.

Roadmap
=======
* [✓] Initial MVP with desktop notifications
* [ ] Fix Windows specific issues

See the `open issues <https://github.com/Jemeni11/TerminalAlert/issues>`_ for a full list of proposed features (and known
issues).

Why did I build this?
=====================
I was cloning a big git repo while coding. I didn't want to monitor it 24/7, so I minimized the terminal and continued
coding. To my surprise, when I checked after 10 minutes, the process had failed. My network connection was unreliable
that day (let's not name the ISP). I retried multiple times, and it failed multiple times. This experience inspired me
to create a tool that could notify me when a terminal command completes.
