Introduction
-----------------------------------------------

FloPy includes support for MODFLOW 6, MODFLOW-2005, MODFLOW-NWT, MODFLOW-USG, and MODFLOW-2000. Other supported MODFLOW-based models include MODPATH (version 6 and 7), MT3DMS, MT3D-USGS, and SEAWAT.

For general modeling issues, please consult a modeling forum, such as the [MODFLOW Users Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/modflow).  Other MODFLOW resources are listed in the [MODFLOW Resources](https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy#modflow-resources) section.


Documentation
-----------------------------------------------

Documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://flopy.readthedocs.io)
and includes information on FloPy; tutorials for using FloPy with MODFLOW 6
and previous versions of MODFLOW, MT3DMS, MT3D-USGS, MODPATH, and ZONEBUDGET;
and code documentation.
