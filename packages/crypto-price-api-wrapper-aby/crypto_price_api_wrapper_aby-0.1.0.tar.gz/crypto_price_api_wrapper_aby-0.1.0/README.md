# Crypto Price

A simple Python package to fetch live cryptocurrency prices using the CoinMarketCap API.

## Installation

To install the `crypto_price` package, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install crypto_price
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (installed automatically with the package)

## Setup

1. First, you'll need to create an account on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) and get your API key.
2. Once you have your API key, you can use it in your code to fetch cryptocurrency data.

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here's an example of how to use the `crypto_price` package to get the live price of Bitcoin (BTC) in USD:

```python
from crypto_price.crypto_price import CryptoPrice

# Initialize the CryptoPrice class with your CoinMarketCap API key
api_key = "YOUR_COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY"
crypto = CryptoPrice(api_key)

# Fetch the price of Bitcoin (BTC) in USD
btc_price = crypto.get_price("BTC", "USD")
print(f"The current price of BTC is {btc_price['price']} USD.")
```

### Fetching Prices for Multiple Cryptocurrencies

You can fetch prices for multiple cryptocurrencies at once:

```python
from crypto_price.crypto_price import CryptoPrice

api_key = "YOUR_COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY"
crypto = CryptoPrice(api_key)

# List of symbols you want to fetch the price for
symbols = ["BTC", "ETH", "XRP"]

# Fetch prices for all cryptocurrencies in INR
prices = crypto.get_prices(symbols, "INR")

for symbol, price_data in prices.items():
    print(f"The current price of {symbol} is {price_data['price']} INR.")
```

### API Wrapper Functions

- **get_price(symbol, convert)**: Fetches the latest price of a single cryptocurrency.  
   - `symbol`: The cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., 'BTC', 'ETH').
   - `convert`: The currency to convert to (default: USD).

- **get_prices(symbols, convert)**: Fetches the latest prices for multiple cryptocurrencies.  
   - `symbols`: List of cryptocurrency symbols (e.g., `['BTC', 'ETH']`).
   - `convert`: The currency to convert to (default: USD).

## Notes

- Ensure you use your own valid CoinMarketCap API key.
- The CoinMarketCap API may have rate limits, so please be mindful of the number of requests.
