Differentiable and accelerated spherical transforms
=================================================================================================================

`S2FFT` is a Python package for computing Fourier transforms on the sphere
and rotation group using JAX and PyTorch. It leverages autodiff to provide differentiable
transforms, which are also deployable on hardware accelerators
(e.g. GPUs and TPUs).

More specifically, `S2FFT` provides support for spin spherical harmonic
and Wigner transforms (for both real and complex signals), with support
for adjoint transformations where needed, and comes with different
optimisations (precompute or not) that one may select depending on
available resources and desired angular resolution $L$.

As of version 1.0.2 `S2FFT` also provides PyTorch implementations of underlying 
precompute transforms. In future releases this support will be extended to our 
on-the-fly algorithms.

As of version 1.1.0 `S2FFT` also provides JAX support for existing C/C++ packages, 
specifically `HEALPix` and `SSHT`. This works by wrapping python bindings with custom 
JAX frontends. Note that currently this C/C++ to JAX interoperability is currently 
limited to CPU, however for many applications this is desirable due to memory 
constraints.
