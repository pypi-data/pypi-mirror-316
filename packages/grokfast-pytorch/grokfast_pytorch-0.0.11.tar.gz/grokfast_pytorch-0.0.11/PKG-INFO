## Grokfast - Pytorch (wip)

Explorations into <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20233v2">"Grokfast, Accelerated Grokking by Amplifying Slow Gradients"</a>, out of Seoul National University in Korea. In particular, will compare it with NAdam on modular addition as well as a few other tasks, since I am curious why those experiments are left out of the paper. If it holds up, will polish it up into a nice package for quick use.

The official repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/ironjr/grokfast">here</a>

## Install

```bash
$ pip install grokfast-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

# toy model

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# import GrokFastAdamW and instantiate with parameters

from grokfast_pytorch import GrokFastAdamW

opt = GrokFastAdamW(
    model.parameters(),
    lr = 1e-4,
    weight_decay = 1e-2
)

# forward and backwards

loss = model(torch.randn(10))
loss.backward()

# optimizer step

opt.step()
opt.zero_grad()
```

## Todo

- [ ] run all experiments on small transformer
    - [ ] modular addition
    - [ ] pathfinder-x
    - [ ] run against nadam and some other optimizers
    - [ ] see if `exp_avg` could be repurposed for amplifying slow grads
- [ ] add the foreach version only if above experiments turn out well
