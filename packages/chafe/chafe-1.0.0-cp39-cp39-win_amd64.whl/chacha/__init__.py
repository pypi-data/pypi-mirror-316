"""This package provides tools for encrypting and decrypting files with
the ChaCha20 stream cipher using a key based on a pass phrase.

It provides two entry points named encrypt and decrypt.  That means
that if this module is in your python path then the module can be
used as follows:

To encrypt a file named myfile:

 % python3 -m chacha.encrypt myfile

You will be prompted for a password, and an encrypted file named
myfile.cha will be created.  The password will be visible until the
encryption is finished, then erased.  (So write it down first!)

To decrypt myfile.cha:

  % python3 -m chacha.decrypt myfile.cha

You will be prompted for the password, and a decrypted file named myfile.
will be created.  The password will be visible until the decryption is
finished, then erased.

To view myfile.cha with less:

  % python3 -m chacha.view myfile.cha

You will be prompted for the password, and the decrypted plaintext
will be piped to less.  The password will be visible until less is
launched, then erased.

If you install this module with pip then the commands will simply be:

  % chacha-encrypt myfile
  % chacha-decrypt myfile.cha
  % chacha-view myfile.cha

    The ChaCha20 key is the sha256 hash of a provided passphrase.  Each
    encryption uses a new randomly generated nonce, which is prepended
    at the start of the byte sequence produced by encrypting a plaintext
    byte sequence.  The nonce is followed by a 16 byte authentication
    tag generated with the Poly1305 algorithm.  The tag is followed by a
    16 bit hash which can be used to check if a user made a typo when
    entering the pass phrase for decryption.

    This class is not suitable for very large files, because it reads
    the entire file into memory before encrypting or decrypting it.
