The Capital License

	Article 1.

		Any works that use this license
		must attempt to avoid ambiguous
		all caps writting.  It's tough 
		to read in braille and speech
		to text might not easily know
		if it's an acronym or not.

		As well, it is very unpleasant.

		Please maintain a calm, tropical
		tonality to your voice, spoken
		or otherwise.

		If you enjoy reading capital letters,
		please consider using a font that 
		displays lower case letters as
		shorter equivalents of their upper
		case counterparts.

	Article 2.

		This "module" and the "license" collectively
		may be best metaphorically understood
		as a region of a homo-sapien skull.
		
		Please treat it with exactly the same
		as you would an actual living homo-sapien
		skull that you have been giving non-exclusive
		license to bioengineer from genetic schematics.
		
		That is the blessing of the author.
		
		However, if this work links to or includes
		"modules" that have restrictions not listed
		in this license, please respect those
		restrictions.
		
		In summation, modification, additions, subtractions,
		inclusions, and exclusions, are at your discretion
		unless otherwise restricted by included
		or linked modules.
