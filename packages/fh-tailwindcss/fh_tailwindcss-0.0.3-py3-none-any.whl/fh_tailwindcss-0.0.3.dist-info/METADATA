              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# FastHTML Tailwind CSS Integration

Welcome to the **FastHTML Tailwind CSS** integration project! This repository offers components and templates to seamlessly integrate **Tailwind CSS** into your FastHTML projects. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to provide unparalleled flexibility and speed in styling your applications.

---

## 📦 Installation

### Step 1: Install Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS requires **Node.js** as a dependency. Follow the steps below to install and configure Tailwind CSS for your project.

#### 1.1 Install Tailwind CSS via npm
Run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

#### 1.2 Configure Template Paths
Update your `tailwind.config.js` file with the paths to your template files:
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

#### 1.3 Add Tailwind Directives to Your CSS
Include the Tailwind CSS directives in your main CSS file (`src/input.css`):
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

#### 1.4 Start the Tailwind CLI Build Process
Run the following command to start the Tailwind CSS build process:
```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```

#### 1.5 Use Custom CSS from fh_tailwindcss

To customize your styles, follow these steps:

Copy the tailwind.css.template file and paste it into your CSS folder.

Import the tailwind.css file into your input.css:
```css
@import './src/static/css/tailwind.css';
```
It will look like this:
```css
/* Add your Tailwind directives if needed */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* input.css */
@import './src/static/css/tailwind.css';
```

### Step 2: Integrate Tailwind CSS into FastHTML

#### 2.1 Link the Compiled CSS File
Include the compiled CSS file in the `<head>` of your FastHTML app:
```python
app, rt = fast_app(
    pico=False,  # We're using Tailwind CSS instead of PicoCSS
    hdrs=(
        Meta(charset="UTF-8"),
        Meta(
            name="viewport",
            content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0",
        ),
        Meta(
            name="description",
            content="FastHTML template using Tailwind CSS for styling",
        ),
        Link(rel="stylesheet", href="/static/css/output.css", type="text/css"),
    ),
    static_path=Path(__file__).parent / "static",
)
```

#### 2.2 Use Tailwind Utility Classes
You can now use Tailwind CSS classes to style your FastHTML templates and components. Here is an example of a styled button:
```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```

---

## 🌟 Features
- **Utility-First Approach:** Tailwind CSS provides a rich set of utility classes for rapid UI development.
- **Customizable Design:** Extend Tailwind's default configuration to match your project's unique needs.
- **Seamless Integration:** Quickly add Tailwind CSS to your FastHTML templates and components.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Leverage the Tailwind CLI for real-time CSS updates during development.

---

## ✨ Custom Build Components
This repository provides a set of custom-built components to enhance your development experience. For example, the **Modal** component:

```python
from fasthtml.common import *
from fh_tailwindcss import GridContainer, LabeledInput

@rt("/")
def get():
    return Form(
        GridContainer(2,
            LabeledInput("User Name", id="user-id", type="text"),
            LabeledInput("Email", id="email", type="email")),
        GridContainer(1,
            LabeledTextarea("Description", id="description", rows=4)))
```
