A comprehensive toolkit for reliably packing and unpacking environments for ComfyUI workflows. 


- üì¶ **Pack workflow environments as artifacts:** Saves the workflow environment in a `.cpack.zip` artifact with Python package versions, ComfyUI and custom node revisions, and model hashes.
- ‚ú® **Unpack artifacts to recreate workflow environments:** Unpacks the `.cpack.zip` artifact to recreate the same environment with the exact Python package versions, ComfyUI and custom node revisions, and model weights.
- üöÄ **Deploy workflows as APIs:** Deploys the workflow as a RESTful API with customizable input and output parameters.

## Motivations

When sharing ComfyUI workflows to others, your audiences or team member, you've likely heard these responses:
- "Custom Node not found"
- "Cannot find the model file"
- "Missing Python dependencies"

These are fundamental challenges in workflow sharing ‚Äì every component must match exactly: custom nodes, model files, and Python dependencies.

We learned it from our communit, and developed Comfy-Pack to address this directly. With a single click, it captures and locks your entire workflow environment into a `.cpack.zip` file, including Python packages, custom nodes, model hashes, and required assets.

Users can recreate the exact environment with one command:
```bash
comfy-pack unpack workflow.cpack.zip
```

Focus on creating. Let Comfy-Pack handle the rest.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Search `comfy-pack` in ComfyUI Manager (Recommended)

![install_node](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbfb730d-edff-4a52-b6c4-695e3ec70368)

or install from Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/comfy-pack.git
```


### Pack a ComfyUI workflow
1. Click "Package" button to create `.cpack.zip`
2. (Optional) select the models that you want to include (only model hash will be recorded, so you wont get a 100GB zip file)
![pack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e08bbed2-84dc-474e-a701-6c6db16edf76)



### Unpack a ComfyUI workflow
```bash
# Restore the full ComfyUI directory from cpack files.
comfy-pack unpack workflow.cpack.zip
```


### Deploy a workflow as an API

## Custom Node List

ComfyPack provides custom nodes for standardizing inputs:
- ImageInput: provides `image` type input, similar to official `LoadImage` node
- StringInput: provides `string` type input, nice for prompts
- IntInput: provides `int` type input, suitable for size or seeds
- AnyInput: provides `combo` type and more input, suitable for custom nodes
- ImageOutput: takes `image` type inputs, similar to official `SaveImage` node, take an image of a bunch of images
- FileOutput: takes file path as `string` type, save and output the file under that path
- ...

These nodes help define clear interfaces for your workflow.

## üöÄ Roadmap
- Docker Support
- local cpack manager and Version Control
- Enhanced service capabilities
