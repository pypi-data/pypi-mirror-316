`Tahoe-LAFS <https://www.tahoe-lafs.org>`__ (Tahoe Least-Authority File Store) is the first free software / open-source storage technology that distributes your data across multiple servers. Even if some servers fail or are taken over by an attacker, the entire file store continues to function correctly, preserving your privacy and security.

üí° About Tahoe-LAFS
-------------------

Tahoe-LAFS helps you to store files while granting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data.

How does it work? You run a client program on your computer, which talks to one or more storage servers on other computers. When you tell your client to store a file, it will encrypt that file, encode it into multiple pieces, then spread those pieces out among various servers. The pieces are all encrypted and protected against modifications. Later, when you ask your client to retrieve the file, it will find the necessary pieces, make sure they haven‚Äôt been corrupted, reassemble them, and decrypt the result.

The client creates pieces (‚Äúshares‚Äù) that have a configurable amount of redundancy, so even if some servers fail, you can still get your data back. Corrupt shares are detected and ignored so that the system can tolerate server-side hard-drive errors. All files are encrypted (with a unique key) before uploading, so even a malicious server operator cannot read your data. The only thing you ask of the servers is that they can (usually) provide the shares when you ask for them: you aren‚Äôt relying upon them for confidentiality, integrity, or absolute availability.

Tahoe-LAFS was first designed in 2007, following the "principle of least authority", a security best practice requiring system components to only have the privilege necessary to complete their intended function and not more.

Please read more about Tahoe-LAFS architecture `here <docs/architecture.rst>`__.
