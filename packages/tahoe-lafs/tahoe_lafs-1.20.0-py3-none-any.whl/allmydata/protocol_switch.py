"""
Support for listening with both HTTPS and Foolscap on the same port.

The goal is to make the transition from Foolscap to HTTPS-based protocols as
simple as possible, with no extra configuration needed.  Listening on the same
port means a user upgrading Tahoe-LAFS will automatically get HTTPS working
with no additional changes.

Use ``create_tub_with_https_support()`` creates a new ``Tub`` that has its
``negotiationClass`` modified to be a new subclass tied to that specific
``Tub`` instance.  Calling ``tub.negotiationClass.add_storage_server(...)``
then adds relevant information for a storage server once it becomes available
later in the configuration process.
