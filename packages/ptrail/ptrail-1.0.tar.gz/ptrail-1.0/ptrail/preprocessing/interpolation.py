"""
    This class interpolates dataframe positions based on Datetime.
    It provides the user with the flexibility to use linear or cubic interpolation.
    In general, the user passes the dataframe, time jum and the interpolation type,
    based on the type the proper function is mapped. And if the time difference
    exceeds the time jump, the interpolated point is added to the position with large jump
    with a time increase of time jump. This interpolated row is added to the dataframe.

            Interpolate the position of an object and create new points using one of
            the interpolation methods provided by the Library. Currently, the library
            supports the following 4 interpolation methods:

                1. Linear Interpolation
                2. Cubic-Spline Interpolation
                3. Kinematic Interpolation
                4. Random Walk Interpolation

            Warning
            -------
                The Interpolation methods will only return the 4 mandatory library columns
                because it is not possible to interpolate other data that may or may not be
                present in the dataset apart from latitude, longitude and datetime. As a
                result, other columns are dropped.

            Note
            ----
                The time-jump parameter specifies where the new points are to be
                inserted based on the time difference between 2 consecutive points.
                However, it does not guarantee that the dataset will be brought down
                to having difference between 2 consecutive points equal to or
                less than the user specified time jump.

            Note
            ----
                The time-jump is specified in seconds. Hence, if the user-specified
                time-jump is not sensible, then the execution of the method will take
                a very long time.
