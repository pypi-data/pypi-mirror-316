# Dependencies

## Python

Tax-Calculator currently runs on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
We generally support at least the three latest major Python releases.

Updating the Python version requires modifying the following files:
* `.github/workflows/*.yml`
* `.travis.yml`
* `appveyor.yml`
* `setup.py`
* `docs/usage/starting.md`
* `docs/contributing/dependencies.md` (this file)
