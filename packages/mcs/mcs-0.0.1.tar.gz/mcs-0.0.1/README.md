## Features

- **Specialized Agent Roles**: Each agent has specific medical expertise and responsibilities
- **Structured Diagnostic Flow**: Organized pipeline from initial assessment to final synthesis
- **ICD-10 Coding Integration**: Comprehensive medical coding at each diagnostic stage
- **Automated Report Generation**: Standardized medical and coding reports
- **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Multi-stage verification and synthesis process

```

## Installation

```bash
pip install swarms
```

## Usage

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize agents
chief_medical_officer = Agent(
    agent_name="Chief Medical Officer",
    system_prompt="""...""",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=1
)

# Create agent list and flow
agents = [chief_medical_officer, virologist, internist, medical_coder, synthesizer]
flow = "Chief Medical Officer -> Virologist -> Internist -> Medical Coder -> Synthesizer"

# Initialize swarm system
diagnosis_system = AgentRearrange(
    name="Medical-coding-diagnosis-swarm",
    description="Comprehensive medical diagnosis and coding system",
    agents=agents,
    flow=flow,
    max_loops=1,
    output_type="all"
)

# Process patient case
patient_case = """
Patient: 45-year-old White Male
Lab Results:
- egfr: 59 ml/min/1.73
- non african-american
"""

diagnosis = diagnosis_system.run(patient_case)
```

## Diagnostic Flow Process

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Patient Case
    participant CMO as Chief Medical Officer
    participant V as Virologist
    participant I as Internist
    participant MC as Medical Coder
    participant S as Synthesizer
    
    P->>CMO: Initial Data
    CMO->>V: Preliminary Assessment
    V->>I: Viral Analysis
    I->>MC: Comprehensive Review
    MC->>S: Coded Diagnosis
    S->>P: Final Report
```

## Output Format

The system generates two main types of reports:

1. **Medical Diagnosis Report**: Clinical findings and recommendations
2. **Coding Report**: Structured ICD-10 codes and documentation

Example Report Structure:
```markdown
# Medical Diagnosis and Coding Report
Generated: [Timestamp]

## Clinical Summary
[Diagnosis Details]

## Coding Summary
### Primary Diagnosis Codes
[ICD-10 Codes]

### Secondary Diagnosis Codes
[Additional Codes]

## Recommendations
[Next Steps]
```

## Lab Range Analysis

The system includes specialized functionality for analyzing lab results against diagnostic criteria:

- Automated range checking for common tests (e.g., eGFR)
- Diagnosis-specific range validation
- Multi-factor analysis for complex diagnoses
