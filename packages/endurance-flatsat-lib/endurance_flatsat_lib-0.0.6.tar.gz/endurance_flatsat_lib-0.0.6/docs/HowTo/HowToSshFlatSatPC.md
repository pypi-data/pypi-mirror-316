# SSH Connection to FlatSat PC
## Introduction

This How To explains how to connect your computer (**client**) to the FlatSat PC (**server**) via SSH connection.

**Note:** currently, SSH connection is only supported if the client is on the same network as the server.

---

## Steps to configure the SSH connection on the client

1. **Instal OpenSSH:** to install the OpenSSH client application, run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-client
```

2. **Generate SSH key:** to generate an SSH key, run the following command and follow the instructions (if you already have an SSH key, jump to the next step):
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
This command  will generate a public key and a private key which will be stored in the ```~/.ssh/``` folder.

3. **Copy the public key to the FlatSat PC server:** to copy your key to the FlatSat PC, run the following command:
```bash
ssh-copy-id infinite-orbits@192.168.1.10
```
If this is the first time you try to connect to the server via SSH, you will need to enter the server password for the infinite-orbits user. If this is successful, from this point forward, you will not need to enter the password again.

## Connect to the server
If you already configured OpenSSH on the client and already copied the public key to the server, you just need to enter the following command to connect to the server:
```bash
ssh infinite-orbits@192.168.1.10
```

## Summary: Using the SSH `config` File

The `~/.ssh/config` file simplifies and automates SSH connections by allowing you to configure host-specific settings. Here's an overview of how to use it effectively:

---

### **Basic SSH Configuration Structure**

```ssh
Host <alias>
    HostName <address_or_IP>
    User <username>
    Port <port_number>
    IdentityFile <path_to_private_key>
```

- **Host**: Alias used in SSH commands.
- **HostName**: Host address or IP.
- **User**: Username for the connection.
- **Port**: (Optional) Port to use (default: 22).
- **IdentityFile**: (Optional) Path to the private key.

---

### **Complete Example**

```ssh
Host myserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User romain
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_myserver
```

Simplified connection:

```bash
ssh myserver
```

---

### **Advanced Configuration**

- **Configure multiple hosts with patterns**:
    
    ```ssh
    Host *.example.com
        User romain
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_example
    ```
    
- **Use a proxy jump**:
    
    ```ssh
    Host internal-host
        HostName 10.0.0.5
        User romain
        ProxyJump jumphost
    ```
    

---

### **Useful Commands**

- **Test the configuration**:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -T myserver
    ```
    
- **Reload the SSH agent**:
    
    ```bash
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
    

---

By setting up a well-configured `config` file, you can avoid specifying connection details every time you use SSH.

## SFTP connection to the Flatsat

In **Files**, select **Other Location**, and in **enter the server address...** :

```
sftp://<user>@192.168.1.10
```

## VNC connection to the Flatsat
