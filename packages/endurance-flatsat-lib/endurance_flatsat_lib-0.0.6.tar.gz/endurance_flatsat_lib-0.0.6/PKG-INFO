This project was automatically generated using the LINCC-Frameworks 
[python-project-template](https://github.com/lincc-frameworks/python-project-template).

A repository badge was added to show that this project uses the python-project-template, however it's up to
you whether or not you'd like to display it!

For more information about the project template see the 
[documentation](https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting Started

### Installation

Ensure that you clone the project with the submodule by doing :

```
git clone https://<USERNAME>:<TOKEN>@github.com/infiniteorbits/endurance-flatsat-lib.git --recurse-submodules
```

Where the Token is created in your personnal Settings > Developper settings > Personnal access tokens > Tokens (classic)

### Dev Guide

Before installing any dependencies or writing code, it's a great idea to create a
virtual environment. LINCC-Frameworks engineers primarily use `conda` to manage virtual
environments. If you have conda installed locally, you can run the following to
create and activate a new environment.

```
>> conda create env -n <env_name> python=3.12
>> conda activate <env_name>
```

Once you have created a new environment, you can install this project for local
development using the following commands:

```
>> pip install -e .'[dev]'
>> pre-commit install
>> conda install pandoc
```

For implementing also the library, please install and set up pre-commit :
```
>> pip install pre-commit
>> pre-commit install
```

Notes:
1. The single quotes around `'[dev]'` may not be required for your operating system.
2. `pre-commit install` will initialize pre-commit for this local repository, so
   that a set of tests will be run prior to completing a local commit. For more
   information, see the Python Project Template documentation on 
   [pre-commit](https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/precommit.html)
3. Install `pandoc` allows you to verify that automatic rendering of Jupyter notebooks
   into documentation for ReadTheDocs works as expected. For more information, see
   the Python Project Template documentation on
   [Sphinx and Python Notebooks](https://lincc-ppt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/practices/sphinx.html#python-notebooks)
