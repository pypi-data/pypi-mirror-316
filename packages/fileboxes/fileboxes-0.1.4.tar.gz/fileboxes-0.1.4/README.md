# Overview
Have you ever wondered how is the internal structure of files like `.docx`, `.pptx` or `.xlsx`?
It is actually just a ZIP with a bunch of `.xml` files inside it, following the Office Open XML file formats.

I like the idea, but I do not like XML.

This project is a way to write your custom file formats with zips and using a pythonic api.
