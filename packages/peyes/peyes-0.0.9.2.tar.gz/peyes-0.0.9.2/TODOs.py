# New Detectors:
# I-DVT - detect fixations by small dispersion, and saccade/SP by velocity
# ML Detectors: hold an instance of model that can be loaded from file or trained
#    I-RF - Random Forest detector (with/without XGBoost)
#    I-1D-CNN - 1D Convolutional Neural Network detector

# Dataset Loaders:
# Create an "Example Dataset" in the pEYES public repository, and add a loader for it
# Add support for EEGEyeNet dataset (require premature downloading and enable only loading from disk)?
