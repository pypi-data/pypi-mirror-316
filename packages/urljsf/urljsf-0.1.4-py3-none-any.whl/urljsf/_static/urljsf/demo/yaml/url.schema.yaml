title: Propose New YAML Task List

required:
  - repo
  - branch

  While the form above provides the content of the `fileData` parameter, this
  form provides the rest of the inputs to the URL template, which uses the
  [`nunjucks`][nunjucks] templating engine.

  Right below this form, a user would see a validation summary of of both forms, followed
  by any custom [`nunjucks`][nunjucks]-based checks.

  > _As this is **only a demonstration**, expect actually submitting the form to
  > redirect to a `404 NOT FOUND` on GitHub_.
