# iloveapi-python

Python api client made for ILoveIMG & ILovePDF based on ILoveAPI (https://www.iloveapi.com/docs/api-reference).

## Usage

```
pip install iloveapi
```

## TODO

- [ ] Typed parameter for all processing tools
- [ ] Command-line interface

## Why not pydantic?

Image / PDF processing tools usually focus on results rather than JSON data, as data type validation is not important to the user.
